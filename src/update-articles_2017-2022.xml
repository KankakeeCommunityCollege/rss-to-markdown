      <title>Social Engineering: Anatomy of an Attack</title>
      <link>https://my.kcc.edu/Lists/CampusNews/CustomDispForm.aspx?ID=1159</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div><b>Article Description:</b> It’s hard not to be intrigued, and even impressed, by the nature of some of these social engineering attacks.</div>
<div><b>Article Category:</b> Update (Faculty and Staff Newsletter)</div>
<div><b>Article Thumbnail:</b> <img alt="" src="/PublishingImages/Update/cybersecurity%20month%20logo.jpg" style="BORDER: 0px solid; "></div>
<div><b>Article Content:</b> <p>It's hard not to be intrigued, and even impressed, by the nature of some of these social engineering attacks.</p><p>About two weeks ago someone reached out to me share a social engineering/phishing attempt that was targeted towards them. It involved PayPal.</p><p>The individual had received an e-mail for a PayPal money request. They were suspicious because they did not recognize the name of the requestor, so they launched the PayPal app on their phone and sure enough there was the money request. So far things are matching up and they are thinking this might be legitimate.</p><p>But what caught their attention next was this. There was a note in the money request that said …</p>
<blockquote style="margin&#58;0px 0px 0px 40px;border&#58;none;padding&#58;0px;"><p>&quot;We've detected that your PayPal account has been accessed fraudulently. If you did not make this transaction, please call us at toll free number +1 (888) 993-xxxx to cancel and claim a refund. If this is not the case, you will be charged $500. 00 today. Within the automated deduction of the amount, this transaction will reflect on PayPal activity after 24 hours. Our Service Hours&#58; (07&#58;00 a. m. to 06&#58;00 p. m. Pacific Time, Monday through Friday).&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The question for the user was &quot;Did PayPal security insert this message in the money request, and do I need to call the toll-free number OR was this placed by the attacker?&quot;</p><p>After further review, the individual decided this was a scam and that message in the money request was from the attacker.</p><p>So what happened here? How can something like this happen? What if the individual had called the number? What can be done to protect yourself? There's a myriad of questions that come to mind and I'll try and answer them with this article.</p><p>First, this hack can be accomplished by anyone. It requires no special training or skills. The attacker simply goes to PayPal and makes a money request, usually by sending it to an individual's e-mail. As part of the money request process, the requestor can elect to insert a note. It is within this field where the &quot;… account has been accessed fraudulently&quot; message is inserted. The attacker then hits [Send Request] and waits, hoping that the recipient will see it as a valid request and call the toll-free number.</p><p>So what is the attacker hoping to accomplish? In this case it is to gain access to the target's personal financial information. That could be credit card number, expiration, card security code, bank account, bank routing information, etc..</p><p>This attack is possible because the PayPal money request application allows a requestor to insert a note. This field does not appear to be validated by PayPal so any message can be inserted.</p><p>But what makes it really clever is that the &quot;red flags&quot; we would normally use to detect a fraudulent message all either check out, i.e. email sent address was service@paypal.com, amount requested from the e-mail and phone app matched OR can be substantiated by the &quot;call PayPal because this request is fraudulent&quot; message, which we might do because we don't recognize the sender's name and do not want to lose $500 dollars.</p><p>So what action could you take if you had received this message and were still uncertain whether it was a legitimate? The best course of action would be to go to PayPal.com and use the contact information from the website to contact them to&#160;determine the legitimacy of the message.</p><p>I hope you found this little tale interesting as well as informative. Social Engineering prays on people's behavior and in this case, they are praying on the individual's fear of losing money. So until next time, &quot;stay safe online&quot; out there!<br></p><p>

<div><b>Article Content:</b> <p><em>Any KCC employee witnessing a medical emergency, including seizure, </em><em><strong>call 911 </strong></em><em>immediately</em><em><strong>.</strong></em></p><p>Medical management of a seizure disorder is not always totally effective. Students who have disclosed their medical condition to the Office of Disability Services (ODS) are encouraged to communicate with their professors about what to expect in the event of a medical episode. ODS will notify instructors of which classes a student with a history of seizures are enrolled in order to be prepared, but because students are not required to disclose any disability, ODS has created this information as a resource in the event a student experiences a seizure in your class. Since most staff and faculty are not medical personnel, it is <strong>KCCs procedure to immediately call 911.</strong></p><p><br>What is a Seizure?</p><p>A seizure is a sudden surge of electrical activity in the brain that usually affects how a person feels or acts for a short time. The three most common seizure disorders are Generalized&#160;<strong>Tonic-Clonic (Grand Mal), The Absence (Petit Mal)</strong>, and&#160;<strong>Complex Partial (Psychomotor or Temporal Lobe</strong>).&#160; Each type has different effects on different individuals.&#160; Not all seizures are as evident as the Grand Mal.&#160; Some are undetectable except to the trained observer. Some seizures can hardly be noticed, while others are totally disabling. Students may be aware when a seizure with convulsions is coming on. The seizures may last from 1 to 3 minutes, and consciousness returns slowly. Students may be drowsy, confused, agitated, or depressed when it's over. Some students have seizures that are difficult to notice. They may &quot;zone out&quot; anywhere from a few seconds to 20 seconds at a time. During the seizure, the students won't be able to hear you, may blink repetitively, make chewing movements, or just stare. They may be completely alert following this kind of seizure. Here are some common questions you may have and hopefully answers that are helpful.<br></p><p><br>What should I do if a student discloses, they have seizures? </p><ul><li>Listen carefully to the information that the student shares.</li><li>Ask questions. &quot;What happens during your seizures?&quot; &quot;How long are your seizures?&quot; &quot;Do you know when you might experience a seizure?&quot; &quot;Are there any 'triggers' that might induce a seizure, such as flicking lights, moving patterns, high stress, sleep deprivation?&quot; &quot;What do you experience after a seizure?&quot;<br></li><li>Identify a place where the student could rest after a seizure if one occurs.</li><li>If you and the student choose to notify the class in advance, inform them that someone in the class may have a seizure, without identifying the student.<br></li><li>Ask if the student needs preferential seating (near the door?).<br></li><li>Recommend the student register with ODS if they haven't done so, to take advantage of full accommodations under federal law.<br></li><li>Look into scheduling an alternative classroom nearby to resume class once first responders arrive and have taken over the situation.<br></li></ul><p>What should I do if an actual seizure occurs? (This information is adapted from the CDC, <a href="https&#58;//www.cdc.gov/epilepsy/about/first-aid.htm">Center for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.)</p><p>For tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizures&#58; </p><ul><li>While the CDC states, &quot;Seizures do not usually require emergency medical attention.&quot; <span style="text-decoration&#58;underline;"><strong>it is KCCs policy to dial 911</strong></span> when a student is experiencing an active grand mal seizure. </li><li>Stay calm.<br></li><li>Ease the person to the floor.<br></li><li>Turn the person gently onto one side. This will help the person breathe.<br></li><li>Clear the area around the person of anything hard or sharp. This can prevent injury.</li><li>Put something soft and flat, like a folded jacket, under his or her head.</li><li>Remove eyeglasses.<br></li><li>Loosen ties or anything around the neck that may make it hard to breathe.<br></li><li>Time the seizure, if possible.<br></li><li>Stay with the student until first responders arrive.</li><li>Ask other students to leave the room.<br>-&#160;Look into scheduling an alternative classroom nearby to resume class once first responders arrive and have taken over the situation.<br></li></ul><ul></ul><p>What should I NOT DO?<br></p><ul><li>Do&#160;<strong>not</strong>&#160;hold the person down or try to stop his or her movements.<br></li><li>Do&#160;<strong>not</strong>&#160;put anything in the person's mouth. This can injure teeth or the jaw. A person having a seizure cannot swallow his or her tongue.<br></li><li>Do&#160;<strong>not</strong>&#160;try to give mouth-to-mouth breaths (like CPR). People usually start breathing again on their own after a seizure.<br></li><li>Do&#160;<strong>not</strong>&#160;offer the person water or food until he or she is fully alert.&#160;</li></ul><p></p><p>For petite mal or complex seizures, 911 may not be necessary <span style="text-decoration&#58;underline;">unless&#58;</span></p><ul><li>You notice there is difficulty breathing or waking after the seizure.<br></li><li>The seizure lasts more than 5 minutes.<br></li><li>The person has another seizure soon after the first one.<br></li><li>The person is hurt.<br></li><li>The seizure happens in water.<br></li><li>The person has other health conditions like diabetes, heart disease, or is pregnant.<br></li></ul><p>What can I expect after a seizure?</p><ul><li>A student may experience significant disorientation, memory loss, loss of concentration, and alternations in behavior as well as fatigue and headaches which can last several days depending on the intensity of the seizure and where the seizure occurs in the brain.<br></li><li>You can expect the student to go home to recover.<br></li></ul><p>What types of accommodations are in place for a student who experiences seizures?</p><p>Seizure disorders are difficult to deal with academically because of the time element lost (particularly during in-class assignments, tests, and other classroom activities). The following information and suggested accommodations will assure that the student with a seizure disorder is afforded every opportunity to succeed academically&#58;<br></p><ul><li>The student should not be penalized for a missed class, even if an attendance policy is in place (there are program exceptions).<br></li><li>Have backup assignments prepared for the student to complete for missed in-class activities.<br></li><li>Permit the student to tape classes and/or assist in securing a volunteer note taker to assure that s/he will have a record of lectures, assignments, class discussions, and announcements.</li><li>Please <strong>be patient</strong> if a student with a seizure disorder asks or repeats questions previously discussed or answered during class.</li><li>Allow the student additional time for tests and examinations in a separate location with reduced distractions.&#160; Oral testing may be appropriate.<br></li><li>Allow students extra out-of-class time (within reason) to catch up or reorient themselves to class notes and/or assignments.</li><li>Look into scheduling an alternative classroom nearby to resume class once first responders arrive and have taken over the situation.<br></li></ul></div>

<div><b>Article Content:</b> <p>Social engineering is the art of manipulating, influencing, or deceiving a person in order to get them to divulge confidential information. The hacker might use the phone, email, snail mail or direct contact to gain illegal access. Phishing, spear phishing, and CEO fraud (aka &quot;whaling&quot;) are all examples of social engineering attacks.</p><p>Those of you may remember a story I shared about how a hacker was able to successfully gain access to an employee's e-mail through a phishing attack and then attempted to contact KCC's payroll department to have that employee's paycheck deposited into an account that the hacker controlled.

<div><b>Article Content:</b> <p>​</p><p><strong>It's Easy to Stay Safe Online</strong></p><p><strong></strong>October is Cybersecurity Awareness Month, a global effort to help everyone stay safe and protected when using technology whenever and however you connect. The theme for the month is &quot;<strong>It's easy to stay safe online</strong>&quot; and Kankakee Community College is happy to support this online safety and education initiative for the first time.&#160;</p><p>Cybersecurity has become one of the largest, most focused topics, both inside and outside, of technology circles over the last several years. From securing learning devices due to a rise in digital learning and remote work, increase of phishing attacks targeting higher education, to coping with the fallout of high‑profile breaches. Some people have a misperception that cybersecurity is beyond everyday people and that it should be left to the professionals. Some people believe that breaches are simply a fact of life and that we should just learn to deal with them. But nothing could be further from the truth.</p><p>As everyday technology users, we have a key role to play in cybersecurity threat prevention, detection, and remediation.&#160;&#160;</p><p>Throughout October, KCC will raise awareness on key best practices that we can implement today to enhance our own cybersecurity and create a more secure environment for everyone.<br></p><p><br></p></div>

<div><b>Article Image Caption:</b> <p>​Best Practices to follow&#160;<br></p></div>
<div><b>Article Content:</b> <p>We have all learned a great deal from Covid these past 2.5 years.&#160; But what have we learned when it comes to hosting or attending meetings?&#160; Here are some best practices to follow&#58;&#160;</p><ul style="list-style-type&#58;disc;"><li><strong>If you are hosting a meeting</strong>, please offer a hybrid option where people can attend in person, or virtually through WebEx or Zoom.&#160; We have employees who work at three other locations besides the Riverfront campus, as well as some employees who might be working remotely that day.&#160; By offering a virtual option, participation in meetings should hopefully increase.<br></li></ul><ul style="list-style-type&#58;disc;"><li>Hosts should keep meetings concise and focused on the agenda - virtual meetings need to be less about the host and more about finding ways to keep all participants engaged.<br></li></ul><ul style="list-style-type&#58;disc;"><li>Hosts need to reserve a room location that allows for hosting virtual meetings.&#160; A list of rooms has been identified in 25Live (KCC's scheduling software). <br></li></ul><ul style="list-style-type&#58;disc;"><li>Hosts will need to launch the virtual meeting software from the in-room computer, which allows the camera/microphone to be available for the meeting.</li></ul><ul style="list-style-type&#58;disc;"><li>Hosts should log on at least 15 minutes before the scheduled time of the meeting just in case any technical difficulties arise.</li></ul><ul style="list-style-type&#58;disc;"><li>Host should use the virtual meeting tools that are appropriate to the virtual meeting platform. For example, use a virtual meeting whiteboard vs an actual whiteboard so that all participants are engaged.</li></ul><p>So what if you are not hosting a meeting, but are <strong>attending a virtual meeting?</strong>&#160; Here are some best practices to follow as well&#58;</p><ul style="list-style-type&#58;disc;"><li>Please contact ITS prior to attending a virtual meeting to ensure you have adequate technology.<br></li></ul><ul style="list-style-type&#58;disc;"><li>Test your virtual meeting platform connection 30 minutes prior to the start of your meeting – this will ensure the functionality of your equipment and that your setup is ready to go.</li></ul><ul style="list-style-type&#58;disc;"><li>Focus on the meeting at hand – attending meetings virtually requires a greater level of discipline as you are subject to many outside distractions during the meeting.</li><ul style="list-style-type&#58;circle;"><li>Move to a location where distractions are less likely to occur<br></li></ul></ul><ul style="list-style-type&#58;disc;"><ul style="list-style-type&#58;circle;"><li>If attending from your campus office,&#160;set your desk phone to Do Not Disturb, close your door, and consider posting an &quot;in-meeting&quot; sign on your door<br></li></ul></ul><ul style="list-style-type&#58;disc;"><ul style="list-style-type&#58;circle;"><li>Reduce/Close applications to minimize distractions on your computer<br></li></ul></ul><ul style="list-style-type&#58;disc;"><ul style="list-style-type&#58;circle;"><li>Run the meeting software in full screen and turn your video on<br></li></ul></ul><ul style="list-style-type&#58;disc;"><ul style="list-style-type&#58;circle;"><li>Remove any pets away from your virtual meeting space<br></li></ul></ul><ul style="list-style-type&#58;disc;"><ul style="list-style-type&#58;circle;"><li>Be sure to MUTE your microphone if you are not speaking, and unmute your microphone when speaking<br></li></ul></ul><ul style="list-style-type&#58;disc;"><li>Use a professional/business appropriate background. If your background is not suitable (e.g. bedroom, messy office) it is recommended that you either move to another location, blur your background, or switch to one of the KCC provided virtual backgrounds. <a href="https&#58;//www.kcc.edu/about/#social-media-at-kcc">https&#58;//www.kcc.edu/about/#social-media-at-kcc</a><br></li></ul><ul style="list-style-type&#58;disc;"><li>No audio or video not related to the meeting should be in the background<br></li></ul><ul style="list-style-type&#58;disc;"><li>Avoid eating or smoking/vaping on camera<br></li></ul><ul style="list-style-type&#58;disc;"><li>Wear normal business casual attire during your virtual meeting<br></li></ul><ul style="list-style-type&#58;disc;"><li>Be engaged and participate in the meeting – avoid multi-tasking and give your full attention to the meeting as if you were meeting face to face&#160;</li></ul><p>Should you have any questions on any of these best practices to follow, please contact David at ext. 8128.<br></p></div>

      <title>​Insights from the RISC Survey</title>
      <link>https://my.kcc.edu/Lists/CampusNews/CustomDispForm.aspx?ID=1118</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div><b>Article Description:</b> Sometimes, connection makes all the difference.</div>
<div><b>Article Category:</b> Update (Faculty and Staff Newsletter)</div>
<div><b>Article Thumbnail:</b> <img alt="" src="/PublishingImages/Update/150x150-dr.-boyd-cartoon-icon.jpg" style="BORDER: 0px solid; "></div>
<div><b>Article Content:</b> <p>(originally posted July 28)</p><p>The introduction to the survey results provides the best description of what the RISC survey is all about&#58; &quot;The Revealing institutional Strengths and Challenges (RISC) survey provides detailed, actionable data about student success.&quot;&#160; More specifically, the survey looks at the challenges students face, interactions with campus offices, and overall perceptions of the college.&#160; For many years, KCC had administered the Noel Levitz Student Satisfaction Indicators (SSI) survey; however, we felt we needed a fresh approach to understanding the student experience at KCC, so we opted to administer the RISC survey in Spring 2022.&#160; The results are now available and reveal a number of important insights we should consider.</p><p>When selecting among 80 unique challenges presented on the survey, 60% of KCC's respondents selected one or more major challenges in the category of &quot;work and personal issues.&quot;&#160; Even more specifically, many of the students who selected this challenge indicated that &quot;work hours do not leave me enough time to study.&quot;&#160; Anecdotally, we've always known that our students' need to work while they study has been a complicating factor in their pursuit of excellence in the classroom, and the data confirm this to be a central challenge facing the students we serve here at KCC.</p><p>Students also provided information about interactions with KCC offices, and the results were mostly positive.&#160; For example, KCC's performance exceeded benchmarks for financial aid, academic advising, student activities, and the EDI Center.&#160; This is great news because it means that our students find support in these offices to be available, concerned, and effective.&#160; We'll need to continue working hard to sustain this level of performance, but we'll also need to be intentional about improving in the one area where we underperformed in relation to the benchmark – counseling services.&#160; As we move into the new academic year, it is going to be so important for all of us to make students aware of the counseling service we have on campus and to reassure our students that it's okay to ask for help.</p><p>Reviewing students' perceptions of KCC gave me a feeling of pride to be a part of this college.&#160; Our students are much more likely than students at other colleges to recommend KCC to a friend.&#160; I can't think of a better compliment one of our students could give us besides making a recommendation to enroll here.&#160; Overall, the RISC survey data show that KCC's students have a great experience here at the college.&#160;</p><p>&quot;I love KCC and all it stands for.&#160; Great way to achieve my dreams that works with my life.&quot;&#160; That's what one student chose to write into the RISC survey.&#160; What an inspiration it is to know that we've played such an important role in helping someone achieve their dreams.&#160; Not every student feels this way, of course, but shouldn't we strive every day to create a student experience like the one this student described? Make it a personal goal to connect with students. A small gesture or interaction can have a real impact.<br></p><p><em>Editor's note&#58; To access RISC results in the my.kcc.edu portal&#58; Menu (top left) &gt; Employees &gt; Institutional Effectiveness &gt; Surveys (under Data Book) &gt;&#160;</em><em>Revealing Institutional Strengths and Concerns (RISC)</em><br></p></div>

<div><b>Article Content:</b> <p>Greetings everyone!&#160; I was asked to create a portal post reminding everyone on what &quot;Proper Dress&quot; looks like.&#160; We do have a policy on Proper Dress, which is listed below&#58;&#160; </p><h2>9.11&#160; &#160;&#160; Proper Dress </h2><p>Employees should recognize that as representatives of the College they are judged not only by the service they render and their actions toward students and the public, but also by their personal appearance. In order to help make a positive impression, the College requests that employees dress appropriately for the position in which they work, and that their attire be neat and clean.&#160; Generally speaking, all employees of the college are expected to wear business casual attire, except on approved &quot;Spirit/Casual Days&quot; in which jeans may be worn if accompanied by a KCC shirt/sweatshirt, or a Cavaliers spirit wear t-shirt.</p><p>Employees of the Physical Plant Department are required to wear uniforms, and certain employees of the ITS department are required to wear KCC collared shirts. Procedures for obtaining and maintaining required uniform apparel can be obtained from the Director of each unit.</p><p>The immediate supervisor or the Human Resources officer may provide guidance or clarification regarding proper dress. </p><p>So what does &quot;business casual&quot; attire look like?&#160; Here are a few examples&#58;&#160; </p><ul><li>Pants that are either cotton, khaki, twill, corduroy, or gabardine fabric (no blue jeans, shorts, or leggings worn as pants)</li><li>Dress/skirt, if desired</li><li>A cotton dress shirt/blouse that buttons down the front, or a knit polo shirt with a collar, or a cardigan, or sweater (no hoodies)</li><li>Dress casual shoes, such as Oxfords, loafer, leather slip-ons, or short boots (no sneakers or crocs)</li><li>Belt</li><li>Tie, if desired<br><br>If anyone has any questions on what is and what isn't appropriate, please contact me directly at ext. 8128.&#160; Thanks in advance for your cooperation.&#160;&#160;<br></li></ul></div>

<div><b>Article Image:</b> <img alt="" height="205" src="/PublishingImages/Update/HRNews.jpg" width="200" style="BORDER: 0px solid; "></div>
<div><b>Article Content:</b> <p style="text-align&#58;justify;"><span style="text-decoration&#58;underline;">Approval of Revised Personnel Policies</span></p><p>In consultation with the Robbins Schwartz legal firm, the administration has prepared two revised policies for the Board's approval. These policies went to the Board as a first reading at the May 9, 2022 board meeting and were approved by the BOT on June 13, 2022.&#160; These revised policies are&#160;effective July 1, 2022. The two revised policies are&#58; 3.5 Selection Process and 16.3 Reduction in Force.&#160;</p><p><strong>3.5 Selection Process </strong></p><p>For supportive staff and professional/technical positions, the search&#160;committee is composed of three to five employees, including a supervisor/administrator, staff coworker, allied staff member, and a professional/technical or supportive staff member if relative to the position. Any qualified application received in the Human Resources Office will be considered by the search committee until the position is filled. Equal Employment Opportunity<span style="text-decoration&#58;underline;"> </span>practices will be followed in the choices and procedures. </p><p>The search committee meets, discusses the applicants, and selects persons to be invited for an on-campus interview. Applicants' current residential distance from KCC should not be a factor in screening. </p><p>Before contacting applicants for interviews, the search committee chairperson contacts the Director of Human Resources to evaluate the proposed interview pool. If needed, the Director of Human Resources may expand the number of qualified applicants who will be interviewed.</p><p>The search committee will develop questions, all of which will be asked at each interview in the same order by the same persons and using a common procedure which will be followed for each interview. The questions are given to the Director of Human Resources to check for EEO conformity before the interviews are scheduled. </p><p>The interviews are scheduled by the Human Resources staff. The search committee is encouraged to hold each interview in the same, accessible location unless a reasonable accommodation is needed. </p><p>For full-time Faculty and Administrative level positions the following search process applies&#58; </p><p>The supervisor submits a request to advertise a vacancy to the appropriate vice president with the recommended deadline to begin the review of applicants.&#160;</p><ol><li>The search committee chairperson and a Human Resources Office representative will identify strategies to encourage diverse candidates to apply for the position.<br>&#160;</li><li>After the search committee has identified the qualified candidates, the committee will select candidates for telephone interviews to be held in a predetermined common location.<br>&#160;</li><li>After the telephone interviews, the committee identifies the candidates to invite for an on-campus interview. With the candidates' permission, reference checks should be made at this stage of the process.<br>&#160;</li><li>Upon completion of the reference checks, up to five candidates may be invited for on-campus interviews.&#160;</li></ol><p>Each candidate will be reimbursed up to $500 for reasonable expenses associated with their travel to Kankakee for the on-campus interview. Receipts of expenditures must be provided and may include food, travel, and lodging only. Additional reimbursement will be provided to candidates at the sole discretion of the college.&#160;</p><p>The telephone interview process above may be waived if the candidates selected for the on-campus interviews are in the KCC District area, and as long as no one in the pool of applicants is interviewed by telephone for any reason other than to reasonably accommodate an applicant in accordance with state and federal laws.&#160;</p><p>Any evaluative tests necessary to establish qualification for the position are administered by the Human Resources staff as part of the interviewing process.&#160;</p><p>During the interview process, the applicant will receive a position description. The search committee is to provide the same interview conditions and questions for all candidates. After all interviews are conducted, the following procedures are followed based on the category of position to be filled&#58;&#160;</p><p><em>Part-time and full-time supportive staff and professional/technical staff</em> – Following the interview, the search committee identifies leading candidates. The search&#160;committee chairperson submits the top recommendations to the immediate supervisor, who consults with the work area Vice President regarding the pros and cons of the candidates. The final choice's application is submitted to the Vice President for Business Affairs and/or the Director of Human Resources to calculate salary and starting dates, based on approved salary charts and procedures. Next the Employment Recommendation Form with reference checks is prepared by the search committee chairperson, recommending the candidate to the supervisor. The form is forwarded to the Director of Human Resources. The position offer is then made to the chosen candidate by the Director of Human Resources, who will offer the salary and establish the starting date, contingent upon successful completion of a background check. If the candidate declines the position offer, the second and third selection candidates may be offered the position, pending the work area Vice President's approval.&#160;</p><p><em>Full-time faculty and Administrator positions</em> – Following the interviews, the search committee selects the three to five leading candidates. Next, the committee's chairperson submits the top candidates' applications to the immediate supervisor, who consults with the work area Vice President, and/or President, regarding the final choice. The final choice's application is submitted to the Vice President for Business Affairs and/or the Director of Human Resources to calculate salary and starting dates, based on approved salary charts and procedures. Next, the Employment Recommendation Form with the reference checks is prepared by the search committee chairperson recommending the candidate to the supervisor. The form is forwarded to the Director of Human Resources. The position offer is then made to the chosen candidate by the Director of Human Resources, who will offer the salary and establish a starting date. If the candidate declines the position offer, the second and third selection candidates may be offered the position, pending VP and/or President's approval.&#160;</p><p>The Director of Human Resources will prepare an employment agenda item for the Board of Trustees' meeting and arranges for the employee's first day.&#160;</p><p>Full-time faculty and administrators may begin the day after Board approval, except for special action by the Board authorizing earlier employment, pending Board approval. All other employees, including supportive staff, and professional/technical staff may begin working, pending Board approval.&#160;</p><p>Notification of employment is sent to each new employee by the Human Resources Office staff and letters of regret are also sent by the Human Resources Office staff to all unsuccessful applicants. As a courtesy, the search committee chairperson contacts the on-campus interviewed candidates to notify them that another candidate has been selected.&#160;</p><p><strong>16.3 Reduction in Force (RIF)</strong></p><p>Kankakee Community College is committed to maintain, wherever possible, the employment of every employee who is performing satisfactorily. However, changing funding levels and patterns and changing community needs may, on occasion, present situations where lack of funding, lack of work, or lack of need for a particular service require a reduction of the number of staff.&#160;</p><p>Reduction in the force of staff may occur at any time throughout the year as the need arises. Reduction in the force of instructional employees and recall of faculty is subject to compliance with the Illinois Public Community Colleges Act. The Board of Trustees shall approve any proposed position reductions before they become effective.&#160;</p><p>After the college has determined that a RIF is the best way to meet the needs of the institution, an analysis should be conducted by the administration to determine the employees who will be laid off. Nondiscriminatory employee selection criteria will be developed and used to select the employees who will be laid off. Common factors used as criteria for reductions may include performance (based on current and previous performance appraisals and other performance documentation, such as warnings or any type of disciplinary actions), redundant roles, skills-based criteria, and longevity.<br></p><p>Each person occupying a position which is eliminated will receive by personal delivery or Certified Mail, a notice of impending layoff not less than two (2) weeks prior to the effective date of the layoff. If, subsequent to notice being given, but prior to the effective date of the layoff, or within 90 days of the day of layoff, an opening should occur or a new position be created, that position shall be offered to a qualified person on layoff. Qualifications shall be determined by the College.&#160;</p><p>The position will be filled from among those laid off or due to be laid off (who express an interest in the position) through the same interview and selection process used to select new employees. If an individual on layoff is offered a position and refuses, no further obligations shall exist to offer that individual any other positions that may become open during the 90-day recall window.&#160;</p><p>Regardless of any other provision of this policy, no person may be placed in a position for which the employee does not meet the basic qualifications, or the employee does not meet a legal or regulatory requirement.<strong><em>&#160;</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Grant-Funded Employees</em></strong><strong><em>&#160;</em></strong></p><p>Persons in positions which are funded by grant monies (defined as non-operational funds and auxiliary funds), in whole or in part, may be laid off at any time with or without advance notice. Persons laid off from grant-funded positions shall not have recall rights or any other right to future or continued employment with Kankakee Community College.&#160;</p><p>Accumulated vacation and compensatory time are paid out to each person on layoff. For purposes of any other fringe benefits, a person on layoff shall be treated the same as a person who has been terminated from employment, except that if a person is re-employed by the College within a period of one (1) year, unused accumulated sick leave from previous KCC employment shall be restored.&#160;<br></p><p>If anyone has any questions, comments, or concerns, please contact David at ext. 8128.<br></p></div>

<div><b>Article Content:</b> <p>​The Office of Disability Services has seen a significant rise in invisible disabilities in recent years. Diagnosis can be emotional, psychological, neurological, and physical in nature and include diagnosis such as Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Seizures, Autism, Lupus, Krones Disease, Bi-Polar, Anxiety to name a few. The Americans with Disabilities Act and Title II of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 require post-secondary institutions to accommodate these disabilities, but this is not always easy to do as sometime these diagnoses can be sporadic or episodic in nature and require accommodations that go beyond the &quot;traditional&quot; accommodations instructors may be accustom to providing. Due to this rise in hidden disabilities, the Office of Disability Services will be offering information articles related to Autism, Traumatic Brain Injury, and Chronic Health Conditions in the upcoming weeks. The goal is to provide some basic facts about these diagnoses and offer suggestions faculty can use to support these students in the classroom.<br><br></p><h1>Supporting Students with Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)<br></h1><p><br></p><p>Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is an invisible disability that may have significant impact on college students educationally, emotionally, and socially. Type of injury sustained (i.e., fall, blow to the head, traffic accident, combat related, or medical condition) can result in a varying symptom such as personality changes, cognitive changes, loss of vision, or physical limitation. These barriers often require individuals with TBI's to take longer to complete a program than their peers which can be demoralizing.<br></p><p><br></p><p>IMPACT OF A TBI<br></p><ul><li>Inability to sustain attention on tasks</li><li>Struggle to comprehension, retain or recall information</li><li>Executive functioning skills such as organization skills</li><li>Impulsivity</li><li>Difficulty seeing, speaking, or hearing</li><li>Reduced social interactions</li><li>Problem solving</li><li>Information processing<br><br></li></ul><p>TEACHING STRATEGIES</p><ul><li><strong>Simplify. </strong>Kim Collins, PhD, Director of Rehabilitation Education Center at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign suggests assisting students in breaking down larger assignments and projects into smaller chunks aids in better retention and recall and ultimately success.</li><li><strong>Provide clear oral and written instructions.</strong> </li><li><strong>Adapting content with technology. </strong>The Colorado Department of Education provides various technology resources educators can use for specific types of learning barriers.

That means it's a big conference and includes numerous presentations from the most innovative and successful community colleges in the United States.&#160; I've been to AACC twice in my career, and I've left each time feeling more committed than ever to the community college mission.&#160; I also leave these conferences feeling motivated to bring back to KCC the many great ideas that our colleagues across the nation are discussing.<br></p><p>In the list below, I'm sharing some of the most significant themes that emerged among the various presentations and in the dynamic conversations they evoked in the hallways and in the informal evening gatherings.&#160;</p><p>In other words, here's what I learned at AACC.</p><p><strong>Community colleges are abandoning the 16-week model.</strong><strong>&#160;</strong></p><p>This theme was pervasive throughout the duration of the conference.&#160; Odessa College in Texas was well ahead of the curve when they &quot;went all in&quot; with 8-week terms in lieu of 16-week semesters.&#160; They felt so strongly about this model that they implemented without a pilot or a phased approach.&#160;&#160; As their president said, &quot;we're not toe-dippers.&quot;&#160; Since making this wholesale change, Odessa reports double-digit enrollment growth and dramatically increased retention rates.&#160; They were also surprised to discover that 8-week terms have led to increased degree and certificate completion for part-time students who find these shorter classes easier to access and complete.&#160; While Odessa College is an early adopter of such a dramatic redesign of their semester's length, so many of the colleges represented at the conference are actively working to move away from the 16-week semester.&#160; Here at KCC, we certainly offer more 8-week course sessions than we had 5 or 10 years ago; however, we have not made the dramatic move away from the 16-week model that other colleges are making.&#160; Do shorter terms create more opportunities for students to stop and start?&#160; Does the shorter timeline make it easier for students to complete courses?&#160; The early results from colleges like Odessa seem to suggest the answer to these questions may be &quot;yes.&quot;</p><p><strong>Colleges are abandoning a &quot;student deficit&quot; model by intentionally fostering a &quot;student asset&quot; mindset which focuses on &quot;cultural wealth.&quot;</strong><strong>&#160;</strong></p><p>As we rethink community college approaches to onboarding new students, it's been a challenge to let go of some of the long-standing practices which were results of a &quot;student deficit&quot; mindset about student success.&#160; For a large part of our history, students' first experience at college has been placement testing.&#160; Upon testing, we've tended to place students into pre-college courses hoping that they'll use this opportunity to become more college ready.&#160; Many of the initiatives discussed at AACC included intentional strategies to move their college culture away from thinking about what students cannot do or do not know.&#160;&#160; Instead, they are adopting a &quot;cultural wealth&quot; mindset intended to focus first on what students can do and the cultural knowledge they bring with them to campus.&#160; To achieve this aim, colleges are creating internal campaigns to learn more about what it means to think about student assets and cultural wealth.&#160; These campaigns focus on stated &quot;commitments&quot; from faculty, staff, and students.&#160; Even more colleges are implementing multiple measures for placement, eliminating developmental education altogether, and removing all barriers to registration and enrollment.&#160; Here at KCC, we've begun the process of using multiple measures for placement, and we've made incredible progress in how we deliver developmental education.&#160; We're headed in the right direction.&#160; Still, I left AACC today wondering if KCC's approaches to student success are informed by a student deficit model or a cultural wealth model.&#160; Perhaps that's a question we can all be asking.</p><p><strong>Retention is a higher priority than ever.</strong><strong>&#160;</strong></p><p>It's always been important for us to retain the students we attract.&#160; This is why we've always measured fall-to-spring and fall-to-fall retention statistics.&#160; As much priority as we place on retention, though, our conversations on campus always seem to move away from retention efforts to focus on recruitment of new students.&#160; Across the nation, colleges are expressing more and more concern that we've not done a good enough job of ensuring that our current students have such a great experience that they return each semester until completion.&#160; The leading colleges in this conversation express similar challenges to what we are facing here at KCC.&#160; There are fewer traditional-aged students in local high schools.&#160; Students are choosing to complete degrees and certificates in non-traditional ways, often moving back and forth between multiple colleges or training providers.&#160; Many people are even losing faith in the value of a college degree or certificate (more on this below), and even more are seeking credentials through non-academic training providers.&#160; Because the market for new students is shrinking and exceedingly difficult to reach, colleges are noting the value of investing time and energy into retaining current students as a way of mitigating enrollment declines.&#160; Are we doing all we can here at KCC to ensure that our students stick with us until they finish?</p><p><strong>We must answer the question about the return on investment of a college education.</strong></p><p>&#160;Of all the themes and trends emerging from the many presentations and discussions at AACC's conference, this one was the most prominent and unsettling one.&#160; Colleges across the nation are sensing among their communities a loss of faith in the higher education system.&#160; Potential students no longer take for granted the value of a degree or credential from a community college.&#160; Given the increasing cost of college, we shouldn't be surprised that students refuse to enroll if they are not convinced that a college credential will be useful, valuable, or will lead to enhanced quality of life and a family-sustaining income.&#160; As community college educators, we feel strongly about the value of KCC's credentials in our local workforce, and we know that KCC graduates have the skills and knowledge to transfer successfully and enter a career pathway.&#160; We get it, but have we successfully told this story in our community?&#160; In my previous blog, I noted that we need to highlight the &quot;tangible assets&quot; of a community college education if we hope to attract and retain students.&#160; Are we doing enough to help our community know that very real and substantial return on investment they will gain from completing a KCC degree or certificate?</p><p>There was a palpable sense of impending change at AACC this year as the nation's community colleges, like KCC, face continued enrollment declines.&#160; We all know, I hope, that what comes next for community colleges looks very different from what came before.&#160; More specifically, there was a sense that only those colleges that are willing to innovate, change, and adapt will be able to survive this thing that Arthur Levine and Scott Van Pelt are calling The Great Upheaval.&#160; As we conclude this academic year, my call to action for KCC is to face our future with a bold willingness to embrace change, participate in innovation, and be comfortable serving students in a different way than we ever have.&#160; If we can move forward with this attitude, I am confident that KCC will be a leader among Illinois' colleges as we shift the model for higher education in our community.&#160;<br></p></div>

program and the Horticulture Club hosted Mrs. Lubben's 4<sup>th</sup>&#160;grade
class from Manteno on Friday, April 29th. The grade school students learned
about growing plants traditionally, in a hydroponics system, and in an
aquaponics system. After starting in the classroom, they toured the greenhouse.
The students finished up their field trip by creating their own science

<div><b>Article Thumbnail:</b> <img alt="" src="/PublishingImages/Update/150x150-dr.-boyd-cartoon-icon.jpg" style="BORDER: 0px solid; "></div>
<div><b>Article Content:</b> <p>​Even if you aren't spending time each day reading and researching current events impacting higher education, you are likely aware that America's colleges and universities are confronting a time of extraordinary change.&#160; Colleges are struggling financially as enrollments have declined, and some have even been forced to close their doors permanently.&#160; Across the nation, the most effective colleges are taking proactive steps to explore the innovations that will drive success into the future, and they are working to implement these new strategies efficiently and sustainably.</p><p>While it's proven uncomfortable if not difficult to embrace many of these changes, it's been almost too easy for us to blame them on a global pandemic.&#160; The truth is that higher education was already on the precipice of a sea change well before we knew about the widespread proliferation of a virus called COVID-19.&#160; As an example, community colleges in Illinois had already suffered a decade-long enrollment decline when we were forced to implement emergency operations planning in March of 2020 which resulted in the temporary closure of campus facilities and a whole-sale shift toward virtual teaching, learning, and support.&#160;</p><p>Even at that time, we had already spent countless hours designing short-term credentials, expanding hybrid and online courses, contemplating competency-based education, and fretting about the impact of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs).&#160; To be sure, we aren't yet fully free from the pandemic, but we've finally obtained enough intellectual and emotional distance from the urgency it required to understand that a virus didn't cause the need for paradigmatic change in higher education; rather, it made the need for change more complex and, perhaps, more immediately necessary.</p><p>In the recent past, I've referenced one such transformation in progress here at Kankakee Community College. Even as I write this column, a cross-functional team of colleagues is working out the final details of implementing KCC's first competency-based education program.&#160; Unlike traditional models which base completion on &quot;seat time&quot; or the number of hours, weeks, and months students are enrolled in a class, this new approach will give students the flexibility to complete their course of study and move on as soon as they are able to demonstrate the skills required.&#160; We're also making our course schedule increasingly more flexible by including a variety of start dates and shorter-term classes stacked intentionally to help students get short term credentials quickly and efficiently.&#160; Why should students wait months before starting a program?&#160; We're even planning a winter term, perfectly designed for students to complete a course during the holiday season if that's a choice that works for them.&#160; Perhaps the most exciting development in the past few years has been the expansion of apprenticeships at KCC so that students can work while they learn.&#160;</p><p>As KCC recovers from these last few tumultuous years, we're asking ourselves the question, &quot;where do we go from here?&quot;&#160; It's our hope that such a question may help us write our &quot;future story.&quot;&#160; We are ready to embrace the need for continued change.&#160; That's exactly what authors Arthur Levine and Scott Van Pelt have done in their book <em>The Great Upheaval&#58; Higher Education's Past, Present, and Uncertain Future</em>.&#160; In this research, the authors look to the past for models of transformational change in higher education.&#160; As they document this history, they also build a predictive framework for what we may expect to happen in higher education.&#160; Perhaps not surprisingly, the comparative models they identify are the music industry, the film industry, and the newspaper industry.</p><p>It's a compelling argument that Levine and Van Pelt make, an argument which has captured the collective attention of the higher education community and so many others across the nation who are both concerned about the current state of higher education and, at the same time, eager to experience sorely needed innovation.&#160; Perhaps higher education is truly in the beginning stages of a sea change.&#160; What will our programs, classes, and services become as we design new models to serve students in the age of a knowledge economy?&#160; In the final pages of their book, Levine and Van Pelt predict that the &quot;disruption faced by regional universities and community colleges will be a matter of attrition&quot; as students choose alternative providers for &quot;cheaper, more convenient, unbundled, and in some cases higher-quality instruction.&quot;&#160; For those among us who recognize the value of the community college mission, this is a dire prediction.&#160; However, a few sentences later, they suggest an alternative path for those colleges who are committed to remaining relevant&#58; &quot;To hold onto their students and escape disruption, these institutions will have to offer some tangible advantage that alternative providers cannot.&quot;</p><p>Here at KCC, we're working hard to develop and refine these &quot;tangible advantages&quot; which will cement KCC as this community's college and the best post-secondary option available in this region we serve.&#160; As this community's college, it's our responsibility and our mission to enhance quality of life by connecting students with family sustaining careers.&#160; This mission will be at the core of all our efforts to transform the strategies and tactics we use to get it done.&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><p>If you've read this far, I suspect you'll find Levine and Van Pelt's argument insightful and engaging.&#160; I hope you'll choose to read it.&#160; Further, I'm extending a formal invitation to join me this summer in a book study of <em>The Great Upheaval</em>.</p><p>We'll coordinate our book study with the summer semester, starting on June 6<sup>th</sup> and concluding on July 28<sup>th</sup>.&#160; Our study will be asynchronous, so you can respond and interact with others on your own time, but you will need to &quot;keep up&quot; with the entire group so that our conversations are timely and engaging.&#160; We'll use the Canvas learning management system to discuss the book and explore ways that we can apply insights gained to how we achieve our mission here at KCC.&#160; One last thing – there will be &quot;work&quot; to do, so be prepared to read, write, and think.&#160;</p><p>Still interested?&#160; If so, send me a note at <a href="mailto&#58;mboyd@kcc.edu">mboyd@kcc.edu</a> telling me why you'd like to be in the first cohort to read and study <em>The Great Upheaval</em>.&#160; Participants will be selected by May 13<sup>th</sup> at which time you'll need to source your own copy of the book and start reading.<br></p></div>

<div><b>Article Content:</b> <p><strong>Take Your Child to Work Day</strong> is an internationally recognized day for children to go to work with their parents. It was originally called Take Your Daughter to Work Day to guide more girls and women into the workforce when it was instated in 1993. While this day was created for U.S. children, it is now celebrated in countries all over the world. Take Your Child to Work Day is held on the fourth Thursday in April annually.<br></p><p><strong>The current goal of Take Your Child to Work Day is to introduce young children to a range of jobs throughout their childhood so that they will have a better idea of what to expect from the workforce when they eventually join it.</strong> </p><p>Take Your Child to Work Day benefits both kids and adults. Bringing your child into work can help humanize you to your colleagues. If your child gets sick, for example, your boss or coworkers may be more understanding if they have met your child. Additionally, it allows your colleagues to see another aspect of your personality and life. The same applies to children. They will see you in a different role than they do at home, and hopefully, gain some understanding about what you do all day at work.</p><p><strong>Do's for Take Your Child to Work Day</strong></p><p>To make Take Your Child to Work Day the best possible experience for both you and your child, please follow this list of do's&#58;</p><ul style="list-style-type&#58;disc;"><li>Research the Programming&#58; know what to expect from the day so both you and your child will be prepared and ready.</li><li>Know the age recommendations&#58; &#160;we don't recommend bringing in kids under 5 years old; additionally, if you work in a location with heavy machinery or other potentially dangerous equipment, consider saving your child's visit until they are in middle or high school.</li><li>Assess your schedule&#58; keep important or lengthy meetings off of your calendar on Take Your Child to Work Day. You may not get as much work done as you normally do, so prepare ahead of time to meet any goals.</li><li>Provide expectations&#58; your child should know how they are to behave at the college. Set clear expectations and consequences.</li><li>Have a backup plan&#58; younger children may not be able to make it through the whole day. Have a caregiver ready to pick up your child if needed.</li><li>Check with your immediate supervisor&#58; be sure to check in with your boss and immediate colleagues before bringing your child in for the day.</li><li>Inform your child's school&#58; call your child's school and let them know their student will be with you for the day rather than in the classroom. Arrange make-up work ahead of time if needed.</li><li>Introduce your child&#58; present your child to your coworkers when you arrive. Model for your child how to meet someone new in a professional setting.</li><li>Reflect on the day afterwards&#58; on the drive home or at dinner that evening, debrief about the day with your child. Ask them what they thought of your workplace, your position and the program.</li></ul><p><strong>Don'ts for Take Your Child to Work Day </strong></p><p>There are some behaviors you will want to avoid to have the most successful Take Your Child to Work Day. Please follow this list of don'ts as well&#58;</p><ul style="list-style-type&#58;disc;"><li>Force your child&#58; if your child does not want to go to work with you, do not force them to. It will only lead to a challenging day for you and your child.</li><li>Overstimulate&#58; know your child's limits. If they are getting overtired or seem to be losing focus, give your child a chance to decompress.</li><li>Bore your child&#58; kids have shorter attention spans than adults. While you may be able to focus on a spreadsheet for several hours, your child may not. Bring something for them to do while you work if needed.</li><li>Ignore your child&#58; don't expect to come into work and leave your child on their own. Make sure you are with them or know where they are at all times.</li><li>Have a bad attitude&#58; if there are parts of your job you do not like or colleagues who are difficult to get along with, try to put that aside for your child. Keep a positive attitude at work with your child present.</li><li>Pretend your job is different&#58; your child will be impressed by whatever it is you do. There is no need to pretend you do something you don't.</li><li>Bring in more than one child&#58; although you may have more than one child, please only bring one child with you each year; then next year, you can bring another child to work.<br></li></ul><div>In support of the families participating in Take Your Child To Work Day, <strong>the EDI Center and the Student Success Center are partnering to have snacks, picture books, coloring sheets and other activities available for children on April 28</strong>. Because the EDI center is a lounge space, we will be operating as a &quot;<strong>Kid's Breakroom&quot;</strong> that day. If younger children are getting restless and parents want to accompany them to the EDI center for a while to have a snack and a little bit of fun, this space is open to them. Please let Whiteny know if there are any additional questions.<br></div><div><br></div><p>Should you have any other&#160;questions pertaining to Take Your Child to Work Day, please contact David at ext. 8128.&#160;&#160;<br></p></div>

      <title>Supporting Students with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD)</title>
      <link>https://my.kcc.edu/Lists/CampusNews/CustomDispForm.aspx?ID=1071</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div><b>Article Description:</b> Part of a series on supporting students with chronic health conditions</div>
<div><b>Article Category:</b> Update (Faculty and Staff Newsletter)</div>
<div><b>Article Thumbnail:</b> <img alt="" src="/PublishingImages/Update/Invisible-disabilities150x150.jpg" style="BORDER: 0px solid; "></div>
<div><b>Article Image:</b> <img alt="" src="/PublishingImages/Update/Invisible-disabilities150x150.jpg" style="BORDER: 0px solid; "></div>
<div><b>Article Content:</b> <p style="text-align&#58;left;">The Office of Disability Services has seen a significant rise in invisible disabilities in recent years. Diagnosis can be emotional, psychological, neurological, and physical in nature and include diagnosis such as Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Seizures, Autism, Lupus, Krones Disease, Bi-Polar, Anxiety to name a few. The Americans with Disabilities Act and Title II of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 require post-secondary institutions to accommodate these disabilities, but this is not always easy to do as sometime these diagnoses can be sporadic or episodic in nature and require accommodations that go beyond the &quot;traditional&quot; accommodations instructors may be accustom to providing. Due to this rise in hidden disabilities, the Office of Disability Services will be offering information articles related to Autism, Traumatic Brain Injury, and Chronic Health Conditions in the upcoming weeks. The goal is to provide some basic facts about these diagnoses and offer suggestions faculty can use to support these students in the classroom.<br></p><h4 style="text-align&#58;left;"><span class="ms-rteFontSize-5"><strong>Supporting Students with Autism Spectrum Disorders</strong></span><br></h4><p style="text-align&#58;left;">The Center of Disease Control (CDC) defines autism as a developmental disability that can cause social, communication and behavioral challenges. Autism affects 1 in 54 individuals and is 4 times more likely to be identified in males compared to females (2020). Often autism is accompanied with secondary and tertiary diagnosis such as epilepsy, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and/or anxiety disorders to name a few (Furfaro, 2018).</p><p style="text-align&#58;left;">Many hear the word &quot;spectrum&quot; and think of a horizontal line that runs from &quot;low-functioning&quot; to &quot;high-functioning&quot; and everybody is supposed to fit neatly in their own dot on the spectrum (Birch, 2020). However, those in the autism community argue the spectrum is not linear at all.</p><p style="text-align&#58;left;"><img src="/PublishingImages/Picture1-autismarticle.png" alt="" style="margin&#58;5px;" /><br></p><p style="text-align&#58;left;">The spectrum is actually circular in shape, broken into various categories (see example below). Through observation and self-identification, medical professionals can determine what areas in the brain are impacted and to what extent. It is unknown why autism can impact functioning in some areas and not in others (Birch, 2020).<br></p><p style="text-align&#58;left;"><img src="/PublishingImages/autismarticle-picture2.png" alt="" style="margin&#58;5px;" /><br></p><p style="text-align&#58;left;">As with any diagnosis or disability there is no one-size fits all and this is true with Autism as well. However, in the college setting, there are some common characteristics that may be observed along with strategies to appropriately and successfully interact and work with students with ASD.<br></p><h4 style="text-align&#58;left;"><span class="ms-rteFontSize-4">LANGUAGE/COMMUNICATION</span><br></h4><ul style="text-align&#58;left;"><li>Verbal Communication</li><ul><li>Inability to initiate and sustain appropriate conversation</li><li>Use of inappropriate responses</li><li>Repetitive language</li><li>Lack of inflection</li></ul><li>Nonverbal Communication</li><ul><li>Lack of facial expression</li><li>Inability to &quot;read&quot; facial expression of others</li><li>Lack of eye contact</li></ul></ul><p style="text-align&#58;left;">Classroom strategies</p><ul style="text-align&#58;left;"><li><strong>Do not assume there is limited cognitive ability </strong>and address the student as you would any other adult or student.</li><li><strong>Avoid using words of phrases that are too familiar or personal. </strong>For example, words like &quot;honey&quot; or &quot;sweetie&quot;, or &quot;cutie&quot;, can come across as demeaning or disrespectful.</li><li><strong>Say what you mean. </strong>When interacting with an adult with ASD, be literal, clear, and concise. Avoid the use of slang, nuance, and sarcasm.</li><li><strong>Take time to listen.</strong> Being an active listener and taking the time to listen lets them know that you care about what they have to say.</li><li><strong>If you ask a question, wait for a response. </strong>Individuals with autism or other special needs sometimes need a little more time to absorb and process information before giving you their response. </li><li><strong>Provide meaningful feedback.</strong> Some adults with ASD may unknowingly communicate inappropriately. Be prepared to provide specific feedback about what in the conversation was inappropriate. Providing feedback that is honest, non-judgmental, and clear can help someone with ASD learn to safely navigate complex social interactions (Walsh, 2010). </li></ul><h4 style="text-align&#58;left;"><span class="ms-rteFontSize-4">MOTOR SKILLS</span></h4><ul style="text-align&#58;left;"><li>Possible observations<br></li><ul><li>Unusual gait, toe-walking, slower walking speed<br></li><li>Difficulty with fine motor skills</li><li>Clumsiness</li><li>Toe-walking (Deweerdt, 2017)<br></li><li>Repetitive behaviors or Stimming - self-stimulatory behavior (Deweerdt, 2020)<br></li></ul></ul><div style="text-align&#58;left;"><div>Classroom Strategies&#58;</div><ul><li>Provide ample time to complete kinesthetic activities i.e., lab experiments or in class written/typed assignments.<br></li><li>Recognize that stimming (repetitive actions or movements) may be an anxiety calming function and do not bring attention to the behavior as long as it is not harmful to the student, others, or impacts class learning.<br></li></ul><h4><span class="ms-rteFontSize-4">PERCEPTION</span><br></h4></div><div style="text-align&#58;left;"><ul><li>Executive Function<br></li><ul><li>Organizing, planning, paying attention, inhibited and/or inappropriate responses (Autism Speaks, n.a.)<br></li></ul></ul><div>SENSORY - How &quot;hyper- or hypo- responsive to stimuli a person is (Milne, et, al., 2017).<br></div></div><div style="text-align&#58;left;"><ul><li>Abrupt, seemingly inappropriate, or rude comments may come from not having enough time to process the information and formulate an appropriate response.<br></li><ul><li>Tend to function in a literal sense, innuendos, sarcasm, and satire can be difficult.<br></li><li>Difficulty speaking in class (social anxiety) or being over chatty or seeming like a know-it-all.<br></li><li>Asking for Help<br></li></ul></ul><div>Classroom Strategies&#58;<br></div></div><div style="text-align&#58;left;"><ul><li>UDL&#58; Universal Design for Learning inculdes&#58;</li><ul><li>Multiple means of access to information</li><li>Multiple means of presentation of information<br></li></ul><li>Using the white board for key words<br></li><li>Adding color in text material to highlight important concepts<br></li><li>Incorporating images to PowerPoints<br></li><li>Showing a video clip or an animation that reinforces an idea<br></li><ul><li>Multiple means of engagement</li></ul><li>Group Work</li><ul><li>Be thoughtful in creating groups</li><li>Let the student know, in advance, of group work so the student can prepare<br></li><li>Introduce the student to group members prior to the activity<br></li><li>Use a &quot;speed dating&quot; system where students rate their compatibility with others in the class through the use of a quick survey tool and use this to establish groups.<br><br></li></ul></ul><div>The most important thing an instructor can do is establish a rapport with the student.

      <title>Reilly and Muhammad named as 2022 Outstanding Faculty Award recipients</title>
      <link>https://my.kcc.edu/Lists/CampusNews/CustomDispForm.aspx?ID=1059</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div><b>Article Description:</b> Announcement of 2022 Outstanding Faculty Awards</div>
<div><b>Article Category:</b> Update (Faculty and Staff Newsletter)</div>
<div><b>Article Thumbnail:</b> <img alt="outstanding faculty medallion" src="/facultyIS/PublishingImages/outstanding_thumb.png" style="BORDER: 0px solid; "></div>
<div><b>Article Content:</b> <p>The Outstanding Full-Time Faculty Member recipient is 
   <strong>Anne Reilly, MSN, RN,</strong> nursing professor in the Health Careers Division.</p> 
<img src="file&#58;///C&#58;/Users/ckeigher/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image002.jpg" alt="" style="width&#58;153px;margin&#58;5px;" /> 
<p style="text-align&#58;left;"> 
   <img src="/facultyIS/PublishingImages/Anne_Update.jpg" alt="" style="float&#58;left;padding-right&#58;10px;width&#58;200px;height&#58;252px;" />By her own admission, Anne was initially reluctant to move into teaching. Encouraged by a nursing colleague, she made the leap to the classroom in 2012. A truly gifted educator, Anne is often the first college professor nursing students encounter in the Certified Nursing Assistant course. She is caring, kind, and an excellent professional role model for them. Both as a nurse and an instructor, Anne never stops learning. She shares that knowledge and expertise with her students, preparing them to become future caregivers. Anne has said before that nothing gives her a greater sense of accomplishment than when she sees a prior student in a health care setting, and they refer to her as Mrs. Reilly. She likes to respond, &quot;Call me Anne, because we are now colleagues.&quot; Outside of KCC, Anne frequently volunteers with Relay for Life and the Alzheimer's Association of Kankakee.</p><p>&#160;<br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>The Outstanding Part-Time Faculty Member recipient is 
   <strong>Dawn Muhammad</strong><strong>,</strong><strong> </strong> 
   <strong>PhD,</strong> who teaches psychology courses in the Liberal Arts and Sciences Division.</p> 
<img src="file&#58;///C&#58;/Users/ckeigher/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image004.jpg" alt="" style="width&#58;154px;margin&#58;5px;" /> 
<p style="text-align&#58;left;"> 
   <img src="/facultyIS/PublishingImages/Dawn_Update.jpg" alt="" style="float&#58;left;padding-right&#58;10px;width&#58;200px;height&#58;250px;" />Dawn is a lifelong learner. She has a passion for learning and shares that passion with her students. An adjunct instructor since 2016, Dr. M, as her students call her, strives to make her classes engaging, dynamic and relevant to all students. Her classroom environment is described as comfortable, inclusive, and conducive to learning. She is currently pursuing a post-doctoral Master of Science in psychopharmacology. Additionally, Dawn works in behavioral health, which affords a symbiotic relationship of theory and real-world experience which she shares in the classroom. Even when a student may not be majoring in psychology, it is her contribution to cultivate empathy and understanding of mental health and other psychological disorders. When she is not teaching or taking a class, Dawn finds time to act on shows such as&#58; The Chi and Chicago Med.</p><p> 
   <em>Anne and Dawn will be KCC's nominees for the annual Illinois Community College Trustees Association outstanding faculty awards presented in June.</em><br></p></div>

      <title>Where Do We Go From Here?</title>
      <link>https://my.kcc.edu/Lists/CampusNews/CustomDispForm.aspx?ID=1052</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div><b>Article Category:</b> Update (Faculty and Staff Newsletter)</div>
<div><b>Article Thumbnail:</b> <img alt="" src="/PublishingImages/Update/150x150-dr.-boyd-cartoon-icon.jpg" style="BORDER: 0px solid; "></div>
<div><b>Article Content:</b> <p>​Where do we go from here?</p><p>In recent months we've confronted the challenging reality that enrollment rates at Kankakee Community College are the lowest they have been since 1984.&#160; Solving the challenges associated with this trend will require us to develop creative solutions and adopt innovative practices.&#160; We have leaned into this challenge and are beginning to realize an opportunity to think differently about many of our programs and services and to consider enhancing them in a way that resonates with so many potential students who have not yet found in KCC's programming an accessible, attractive, or flexible enough pathway to achieve their goals.&#160;&#160;</p><p>We're also working strategically to enhance KCC's capacity and ability to innovate and address problems with creative solutions.&#160; As an example of this strategic approach, Dr. Battle recently led a team of KCC employees through a competency-based education &quot;bootcamp&quot; experience.&#160; The team she led participated in a series of training sessions during the summer of 2021 and obtained the knowledge and expertise they needed to design competency-based educational programming here at KCC.&#160;</p><p>Competency-based education, or CBE, is one &quot;model-shift&quot; occurring in higher education.&#160; Unlike more traditional approaches to designing college courses in which students must meet &quot;seat-time&quot; requirements by being in class for a specified number of hours, days, and weeks, a competency-based model allows students to advance at their own pace based upon demonstration that they have met or exceeded expectations outlined in the course materials.&#160; This approach to academic and career programs has potential to enhance flexibility and accessibility.&#160; Because students can work on skills at their own pace, there is an opportunity to fit a KCC education into their complex lives and schedules.&#160; &#160;</p><p>Professor Lamanda Baade, Professor and Program Director of Medical Laboratory Technology here at KCC, heard the call to action and accepted Dr. Battle's invitation to participate in the bootcamp experience.&#160; Professor Baade knew that a competency-based approach may be the strategic and innovative solution KCC needs to embrace as a way of positioning the phlebotomy program to attract and retain more students in future semesters.&#160; Along with the other members of Dr. Battle's CBE bootcamp, Professor Baade has significantly redesigned the phlebotomy program which is now poised to become KCC's first competency-based education program.</p><p>This is great news, of course, because it represents strategic and innovative efforts to make KCC's programs and services more accessible.&#160; It's also great news because it helps us learn more about what it takes to be innovative and entrepreneurial as a college.&#160;&#160; It starts with an <span style="text-decoration&#58;underline;"><strong><em>attitude</em></strong></span>, of course, and I appreciate the willingness of the participants in the CBE bootcamp who were brave enough to recognize a problem and committed enough to seek a creative solution.&#160; This team also understood that <span style="text-decoration&#58;underline;"><strong><em>collaboration</em></strong></span> was a key to their early success, and the bootcamp team knew that successful implementation would require knowledge and resources from all corners of the college.&#160; The early successes and achievements gained as a result of this project have inspired <span style="text-decoration&#58;underline;"><strong><em>confidence</em></strong></span> in KCC's capacity for developing creative solutions and innovations. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><p>Future results and outcomes of this newly designed phlebotomy pathway will teach us more about flexible program design for our academic and career programs, and we'll all be waiting with eager anticipation to see how students respond to the opportunity.&#160; Further, I hope that the successful implementation of a competency-based education approach in our medical laboratory technology program is just the beginning of the next phase in KCC's history.&#160; Perhaps this strategic innovation is a leading indicator that KCC is ready to embrace a call to action and become a truly entrepreneurial community college.&#160;</p><p>As for my own personal response to this strategic initiative, I am encouraged by the achievements the CBE Bootcamp team has already made since convening for the first time last summer.&#160;

<div><b>Article Content:</b> <p>​The Office of Disability Services has seen a significant rise in invisible disabilities in recent years. Diagnoses can be emotional, psychological, neurological, and physical in nature and include diagnoses such as Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Seizures, Autism, Lupus, Chron's Disease, Bi-Polar, Anxiety to name a&#160;few. The Americans with Disabilities Act and Title II of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 require post-secondary institutions to accommodate these disabilities, but this is not always easy to do as sometime these diagnoses can be sporadic or episodic in nature and require accommodations that go beyond the “traditional” accommodations instructors may be accustom to providing. Due to this rise in hidden disabilities, the Office of Disability Services&#160;will be offering information articles related to Autism, Traumatic Brain Injury, and Chronic Health Conditions in the upcoming weeks. The goal is to provide some basic facts about these diagnoses and offer suggestions faculty can use to support these students in the classroom.&#160;<br></p><h1>Supporting Students with Chronic Health Conditions<br></h1><p>According to the CDC (Center for Disease Control) 60% of adults in the US have a chronic disease and 40% have two or more (2021) so it stands to reason that KCC serves a number of students with chronic health conditions. In the last 5 years the Office of Disability Services have served students with chronic conditions such as sickle cell anemia, lupus, cystic fibrosis, multiple sclerosis, Crohn’s Disease, cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, seizure disorders and heart disease to name a few. Symptoms related to these conditions can be sporadic in nature and occur unexpectedly. When a student experiences an exacerbation of an invisible and chronic disability, one of the common side-effects is missing class. While this can be challenging from an instructor’s perspective, keep in mind the following.<br></p><ul><li><p>The student didn’t ask for this disease and would give anything to not have the condition.</p></li><li><p>Not only are these students battling a chronic illness, but often a psychological/emotional struggle as well. One student reported, “I just graduated high school and I want to go to college the same as my peers even with this condition. Is that too much to ask?”&#160;Another student states, “I just want to have as ‘normal’ a life as I can.”</p></li><li><p>In many cases, students with chronic illness are still coming to class even when they don’t feel like and in some cases probably should be home.</p></li><li><p>Some students need to go to larger cities or even other states to find the medical support and treatments needed for their disease. KCC’s ODS served a 19-year-old student whose specialist for a certain type of brain cancer was in California.</p></li><li><p>Many students report feelings of embarrassment, shame, and guilt. “I don’t like having to ask my professor extensions, but I don’t have a choice when I get sick,” reports one student. Another student comments, “I worry the teacher will look down on me when I have to leave the classroom a couple of times [during lecture] due to my illness.”&#160;</p></li><li><p>Some flare-ups require hospitalization or extended recovery time. A student with sickle cell anemia may spend days in the hospital to mange the pain from the disease. The student reports, “I am living in a haze from the pain medication and have tried to attend Zoom classes.” Another student with a seizure disorder reports, “After having a grand-mal seizure, I am often unsure of where I am and am foggy for hours afterwards.”</p></li><li><p>Students with a chronic illness often do not take attending classes for granted. One student reported, “I love going to class and hate missing, but sometimes I simply can’t go.”</p></li></ul><p>As a faculty member having to accommodate these invisible disabilities, please keep in mind that students have provided documentation of the diagnosis from a qualified medical professional and are legally entitled to the accommodations articulated in the Accommodation Letter.&#160;Be careful to keep biases in check and consider the following&#58;</p><ul><li><p>Punitive consequences can exasperate the issues these students face by increasing their stress levels and create more issues for them.” (Curtis, 2020)</p></li><li><p>For many students with chronic illnesses, even courses with more flexible attendance policies become daunting. (West, 2018)</p></li></ul><p>Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Title II protects students with chronic illnesses and upon completing the Office of Disability Services registration process that includes providing documentation of the diagnosis, a student must be granted reasonable accommodations which may included deadline extensions and assignments, waiver on attendance policies. Naturally, the next question is “How can I make my class more universally designed so the impact of such an accommodation request doesn’t become such a hardship to me?”</p><div><ul><li><p>Take the student’s word for it. Be willing to accept the student’s word for the absences after the accommodation letter is received.&#160;</p></li><li><p>Utilize CANVAS. Post as much information and materials in CANVAS as possible, so the student having to miss class can access course information.</p></li><li><p>Consider recording lecture. Most of our classrooms now have Hyflex technology. Record and post lecture so the student is up to speed with the information.</p></li><li><p>Be approachable. Students with chronic illnesses often feel they are a burden and don’t want to cause you more work, but the reality is sometimes they must. Being approachable reduces a student’s anxiety and can ultimately reduce flare-ups from their illness.</p></li><li><p>Class and exam breaks. Realize that some students may need to step out of the class or even take breaks during exams due to their condition. ODS encourages students to communicate this need to you and recommends the student sit near the door to reduce distraction to other students. If your class runs for an extended period of time, consider having a brief 5-minute break.</p></li><li><p>Be reasonable when adjusting assignment deadlines. There are no governing statutes regarding how much time a student should be given to make up work when a student experiences an exacerbation of their disability. Work with the student to set reasonable deadlines to submit work.&#160;</p></li><li><p>Makeup exams should not be punitive in nature. If a student misses an exam due to the disability-related condition, the instructor should allow the student to make up the exam as taken by the other students. Put exams in CANVAS and decide if a time limit is necessary.</p></li><li><p>Follow the golden rule. Treat the student as you would like to be treated.&#160;<br></p></li></ul></div><h2>Resources&#58;<br></h2><div><ul><li><p>Cdc.gov. 2021. <a href="https&#58;//www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/about/index.htm" target="_blank">About Chronic Diseases</a> | CDC.

      <description><![CDATA[<div><b>Article Description:</b> Continued decline in enrollment must be a &quot;call to action&quot; for all of us. </div>
<div><b>Article Category:</b> Update (Faculty and Staff Newsletter)</div>
<div><b>Article Thumbnail:</b> <img alt="" src="/PublishingImages/Update/150x150-dr.-boyd-cartoon-icon.jpg" style="BORDER: 0px solid; "></div>
<div><b>Article Content:</b> <p>As we enter a new calendar year, we have an opportunity to face our challenges with a new outlook and a new perspective.&#160;</p><p>At my all-college address to open the spring 2022 term, I mentioned that enrollment trends during the registration cycle signaled another enrollment decline this term.&#160; Indeed, this prediction was accurate as census day numbers show the college to be nearly -9% down in headcount and nearly -8% down in credit hours.&#160; This decline follows what we saw in the fall of 2021.&#160; It would be irresponsible for us, as a college community, if we did not confront the basic fact that credit hour enrollment at KCC has declined by 25% since the fall of 2016.&#160; Additionally, we can't afford to ignore the reality that our college's revenue is tied directly to credit hour enrollment.&#160; Certainly, we are experiencing a time of great change in our college's history.</p><p>I also mentioned in my all-college address that these factors should not lead us to panic, despair, or even complacency.&#160; I believe strongly in our institutional mission to enhance quality of life through learning, and the commitment I've made to our students' success drives me to give all of my professional energy to Kankakee Community College and the work we do.&#160; I know that so many of you feel the same way that I do.&#160; I know this because I sense in our college culture right now a spirit of optimism about our future, an energized approach to changing the way we offer our services, and a willingness to think outside the box in creating access to our academic programs.</p><p>We're on the precipice of a new era for KCC, and I'm finding it very exciting to be here for this part of our story.&#160; I hope you do as well.&#160; One of the things that encourages me about our future is the spirt of innovation I am hearing in the conversations we are having about our shared future.&#160; Consider all the initiatives we are pursuing at present time&#58;</p><p>·&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Guided Pathways<br>·&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Enhancing Retention and Early Alert using Technology<br>·&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Enabling access to instruction with HyFlex modality<br>·&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Work-based learning<br>·&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Competency-based instruction</p><p>There are other initiatives we can add to the list as well, and I hope we'll continue to innovate and design new solutions to the challenges we face as we pursue our mission. &#160;&#160;</p><p>What I also see in this list is an insight I hope you see as well.&#160; Achieving the goals at the core of each of these initiatives will certainly make us a better college at this moment in our history, but they also will bring us &quot;back to the basics&quot; of what we are doing here at KCC.&#160; Consider that these projects are helping us to refresh and reenergize our approaches to the fundamentals of what we need to do in order to be a great college.&#160;</p><p>·&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Engage and recruit potential students.<br>·&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Connect them to high quality, accessible courses and programs.<br>·&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Coach them to completion.</p><p>These fundamental concepts that guide our efforts haven't changed.&#160; Perhaps what has changed is our communities' and our students' expectations for how we do these things.&#160;</p><p>Continued decline in enrollment at KCC must be a &quot;call to action&quot; for all of us.&#160; It's time for us to develop a sense of urgency related to our current initiatives.&#160; Robust discussion and debate are essential, but we must also be prepared to ideate, prototype, test, and implement quickly.&#160; It's time for risk-taking and stepping out of the box even if doing so pushes against the systems and processes which we have in place currently.&#160; This is what will be required to develop a culture of design thinking and entrepreneurialism at KCC.</p><p>In order for this to work, we'll also need to avoid dissent and distrust.&#160; In working with each other, we must set our default mode to collaboration, trust, encouragement, and empowerment.&#160; Let's direct our energy toward building supportive professional networks and away from tearing others down.&#160; If you haven't been or aren't currently actively engaged in an improvement initiative, please talk with your supervisor to find ways to contribute.</p><p>We need to realize that we are now a smaller college today than we were as far back as 1984; however, one of our strengths right now is our size.&#160; As an organization which understands the need for change, we can be nimble and agile as we build best practices for post-pandemic success.&#160; Because we are a small college, we have a very flat organizational structure which means we have capacity to communicate efficiently and clearly across divisions and units.</p><p>The most important strength we have right now is the people who are KCC.&#160; With so many of us new to the college or new to our roles at the college, we are poised to invent and design new ways to reach students who haven't considered KCC and to retain those we've lost in the past.&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><p>We are facing another substantial enrollment decline, and we'll now begin to address the challenges this decline will present us.&#160; Despite this setback, I remain encouraged about our future as a college.&#160; I hope you share my enthusiasm and accept this call to action.&#160;<br></p></div>

<div><b>Article Content:</b> <p>​Starting next week&#160;(before Dec. 10), KCC employees will&#160;be required to&#160;use multi-factor authentication (MFA) to access email and resources connected to it.</p><p>For the&#160;new process,&#160;employees verify themselves using another device, commonly a mobile phone, when logging in&#160;to their email accounts.&#160;</p><p>The change follows recent updates to KCC's systems security protocols.&#160;The process has been tested with a pilot group, including members of the President's&#160;Cabinet.&#160;</p><p>&quot;MFA is an extra layer of security designed to ensure that you're the only person who can access your KCC account, even if your password is stolen,&quot; said Michael OConnor, director of Information Technology Services. &quot;Given today's current cybersecurity landscape,&#160;KCC's online services and accounts are high-priority targets for hackers.&#160;MFA&#160;will&#160;improve KCC's overall cybersecurity resulting in better data protection for the college.&quot;</p><p>ITS will send detailed information and instructions next Monday (Dec. 6) to help everyone understand and use the new authentication system.<br></p></div>

<div><b>Article Content:</b> <p>My family and I love the neighborhood where we live.&#160;We love the whole community, but it's our neighborhood that is really special.&#160;I frequently tell my neighbors, &quot;Don't wait for the invite, come on over.&quot;&#160;It's that kind of place.</p><p>If you've paid any attention to the local media in recent months, you may have learned that recent census data shows a population decline in most of our communities across the Kankakee region.&#160;These are curious statistics given the incredible opportunity and growth of business and industry happening right now.&#160;</p><p>Did you know that Kankakee County ranks #5 among small manufacturing economies in the U.S. according to <a href="https&#58;//advisorsmith.com/data/top-cities-where-u-s-manufacturing-is-thriving/" target="_blank">AdvisorSmith</a>?&#160;Currently, there are 7,558 jobs available here which is 104% above the national average.&#160;The future looks even better for us, and EMSI Labor Market Analytics predict a positive growth in manufacturing jobs of +16% for our region between 2021-2031.&#160;What's even more exciting is that the average earnings in these jobs is $96,622.00.</p><p>Family-sustaining career opportunities are abundant in our community right now, and we can expect even more opportunities in the near future.&#160;At Kankakee Community College, we see it as our mission to help anyone find the pathway to these family-sustaining careers.&#160;In early October, the <em>Daily Journal</em> broke the news about Northern Illinois University's recent <a href="/Documents/Economic%20Impact%20Study.pdf" target="_blank">Economic Impact Study</a>&#160;of Kankakee Community College.&#160;That study determined that KCC's graduates can expect an extra $741,997.00 in lifetime earnings in comparison to others who choose not to attend college.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><p>NIU's study confirms the value of a KCC degree, and the return on investment is substantial.&#160;We didn't need the data scientists at NIU to tell us, but it sure is nice to have the proof.</p><p>With so much opportunity, it's hard not to be optimistic about our future which is why the population decline we are witnessing is so confusing.&#160;Here at Kankakee Community College, we know we have a role to play in reversing this trend.&#160;We are on a mission to connect local residents with really great careers, the kind of careers that sustain strong and healthy families.&#160;We also know that strong and healthy families create strong and healthy communities, and we believe in the power of community.</p><p>I mentioned above how much I love my neighborhood and the community where my family and I live.&#160;It's warm, welcoming, friendly, and supportive. I feel like I belong here.&#160;It's my hope that we are creating a similar&#160;environment at Kankakee Community College.&#160;So, I hope no one waits for the invite.&#160;Tell everyone you know to come on over!&#160;We'd love to see you on campus very soon, and we hope you'll bring a friend along with you.<br></p></div>

<div><b>Article Content:</b> <p><img src="/PublishingImages/halloween-2019-all-250.jpg" class="ms-rtePosition-1" alt="" style="margin&#58;5px;" />Time for a little fun on campus! The annual Halloween contest will be on Friday, Oct. 29, 2021. The last 18 months or so have been very stressful for many and it is time to relax for a bit and have some fun in the form of 'Tricks or Treats'.</p><p>Many departments or individuals competed for the coveted Traveling Tacky Trophy over the years. There is also a trophy for the best individual costume. The winners can display the particular trophy until the next year's event.</p><p>Keep your theme under wraps until the day. </p><p>In order to be fair, voting will be two separate ballots one by staff (and student workers) only as they are able to visit all areas of the campus; and one by students who may not be able to get to all areas of the campus (example Marketing department). </p><p><strong class="ms-rteForeColor-2" style="">Those who are part of a department theme&#160;cannot&#160;vote for best theme, but&#160;should&#160;definitely vote for best individual costume.</strong></p><p>If your department or staff in your area would like to get into the spirit of the day, please contact me, <a href="mailto&#58;ebecvar@kcc.edu">ebecvar@kcc.edu</a> or 815-802-8253 by Friday, Oct. 22.</p><p>Thanks and Game On!!</p><p>Liz Becvar</p><p>Marketing Department<br></p><p><br></p></div>

<div><b>Article Content:</b> <p>​In my first blog post, I promised future entries providing more analysis of the recent employee satisfaction survey.&#160;While I do plan to revisit those survey data sometime soon, it's more urgent for me to write some words about KCC's response to recent vaccination mandates.&#160;</p><p>Let me start by stating my own thoughts on this issue.&#160;The best way to end the COVID-19 pandemic is for as many people as possible to become fully vaccinated against the virus.&#160;Vaccines are widely available, free, effective, and safe.&#160;If you are already vaccinated, thank you.&#160;If you are not, I hope you'll make that choice very soon.</p><p>As of yesterday morning, just 52% of all KCC employees have submitted proof of vaccination.&#160;I hope we can improve this percentage by the deadline of September 19th. Even more discouraging, though, is the fact that only 17% of KCC students have submitted their proof of vaccination.&#160;We can do better than this; in fact, we need to do better than this if we hope to move forward and achieve our mission of enhancing quality of life through learning.</p><p>I'm so proud of how this college has endured the challenges of COVID-19.&#160;From the early days, we met these challenges with resolve.&#160;Though we closed our doors for a short time, we refused to let the virus become a barrier to accessing the instruction, training, support, coaching, mentoring, and guidance we provide. We adapted our behaviors to meet students' needs.&#160;We went above and beyond to provide flexible service and instruction.&#160;We took extraordinary measures to make our campus environments healthy because we knew it was important for students to continue their education and for employees to thrive in our careers.</p><p>I'm not only proud, but I'm also grateful.&#160;I'm grateful for the work you've all done in the last two years.&#160;As grateful as I am, though, I need to ask you to face another COVID-19 challenge with bravery.<br></p><p>If you aren't already, please make an appointment to receive a COVID-19 vaccination.&#160;If you are already vaccinated, please take the opportunity to share with others how safe and painless the process really is.&#160;Be a kind, gentle, and empathetic influence in others' lives. That's our role as educators isn't it? &#160;&#160;</p><p>There are now state and federal mandates in place for employers including Kankakee Community College.&#160;Illinois' mandate goes into full effect on September 19<sup>th</sup>, and KCC will be required to comply with these executive orders.&#160;While Illinois' order provides some allowance for weekly testing as an alternative to vaccination, this allowance stops short of providing exemptions due to convenience or availability of testing supplies.&#160;So many of us at the college are working hard to provide on-site testing as an amenity to employees or students; however, we will likely be required to comply with the mandate even when testing is not readily available on our campus locations.&#160;</p><p>This isn't going away!&#160;</p><p>By this, I mean to say that the vaccination mandate isn't going away, and KCC's compliance with the mandate will be under close scrutiny.&#160;As we move ahead toward the deadline, KCC will enhance our efforts to ensure that everyone is vaccinated.&#160;This begins today, with outreach to employees and students.&#160;We'll make every effort in the coming weeks to provide information, education, and opportunities to become vaccinated.&#160;If these efforts are not successful, KCC will be faced with the choice of taking additional steps to ensure that KCC maintains its recognition as a community college in Illinois by complying with the executive orders in place at this time.&#160;</p><p>By saying &quot;this isn't going away,&quot; I also mean that this pandemic and the illness caused by this virus, isn't going away until as many people as possible become fully vaccinated.</p><p>As our community's college, KCC has an important role to play in this region we serve.&#160;For our students and clients, we are a lifeline to important knowledge, to valuable training, to enhanced quality of life, to the liberation that comes from education.&#160;We can only achieve our mission if we can remain open to our community.&#160;</p><p>Individually, you play an important role in how this college operates.&#160;I hope you are proud of that, and I hope you are proud to tell everyone you know that you are a part of KCC and you are an essential part of making this college what it is.&#160;Most importantly, I hope you see a future for yourself here…working on our important mission together.&#160;&#160; &#160;</p><p>Our future, the future of our college, depends upon finding a way to move beyond COVID-19 and the horrible impact it's already had on our community.&#160;The best path to that future is vaccination.&#160;We've already fought through so many challenges together, and now I'm asking that you fight through this one as well.<br></p></div>

<div><b>Article Content:</b> <p>​KCC's campus started as farm ground, with very few trees.&#160;<br></p><p>Under retired KCC President Dr.&#160;L.H. Horton Jr., a concerted effort began to plant trees and cultivate other green spaces on the 176.6 acre (more or less)&#160;campus.<br></p><p>After Horton retired in 1987, efforts to beautify KCC and keep plentiful greenspaces continued.&#160;<br></p><p>Coming soon, <a href="http&#58;//www.kcc.edu/">KCC's website</a> will have a page dedicated to our&#160;greenspaces--with reflections on the&#160;past, details on the&#160;present, and&#160;thoughts on the&#160;future.<br></p><p>The content has nuggets including&#58;<br></p><ul><li>The estimated number of trees that were planted by teenagers during summer programs.</li><li>The new college&#160;acreage.</li><li>How much of KCC's&#160;acreage is dedicated to farmland.</li><li>Why some trees have ribbons.</li><li>Past and current collaborators, including the Morton Arboretum, University of Illinois students&#160;and University of Illinois Extension Office.<br></li><li>A&#160;burgeoning&#160;fruit tree orchard.<br></li><li>Current considerations for cutting down, cutting back, pruning or removing trees and plantings.<br></li></ul><p>
   The page will also have pictures of KCC trees and open spaces through the years.<br></p><p>Another <em>Update</em> article will be posted when the page goes live -- hopefully within the next few weeks.<br></p></div>

<div><b>Article Content:</b> <p>​It's that time of year for the colleges annual fire drills. Due COVID restrictions we have not had a drill in the past year. We are mandated to have two drills per caledar year. I work with the faculty President Steve DePasquale&#160;on determining&#160;the dates for the drills.&#160;This year fire drill&#160;for morning will be September 16th, 2021 at 9&#58;15 am.

<div><b>Article Content:</b> <p>Dear KCC Community,<br></p><p>This is the first of a series of blogs that I will post on a regular basis as a KCC Update article.&#160;The goal of this project is to enhance communication by finding new ways to share information and generate productive dialogue at KCC.&#160;My vision is that these posts will be brief but timely discussions of relevant topics.</p><p>The impulse for starting this blog series came from my first reading of results from our recent administration of the Noel Levitz Employee Satisfaction Survey.&#160;You may recall that we administered this survey while we were in a very challenging stage of the covid-19 pandemic, yet it revealed some very encouraging things about employee satisfaction at KCC.&#160;These survey results, overall, are incredibly positive.&#160;You can read more on&#160;<a href="/Lists/CampusNews/CustomDispForm.aspx?ID=933&amp;RootFolder=%2FLists%2FCampusNews&amp;Source=https%3A%2F%2Fmy%2Ekcc%2Eedu%2Ffaculty%2FPages%2FShow%2Dall%2DNewsletter%2Easpx">this update article</a>. If you were at my all-college address in August or watched the recording of it, you already know that KCC's satisfaction scores surpass those of other colleges across the nation.&#160;You also heard me mention that I'd be sharing more information from the qualitative portion of the survey in which employees write candid responses in their own words.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><p>Whenever the entire employee group from a large organization is surveyed, the results are incredibly varied.&#160;For example, this same survey administered at the same time elicited responses like those which follow and share very different perceptions of our college climate.&#160;&#160;</p><ul style="list-style-type&#58;disc;"><li>&quot;KCC is a second home for me. It has welcomed me with open arm and I have become a part of KCC and its culture.&#160; We are not only co workers we are friends and family.&#160; KCC is a safe place for faculty, staff, and students.&#160; I truly believe it is a great place and I would recommend highly for anyone to take classes or work here!&quot;&#160;</li><li>&quot;miserable, our department is listening to people that are rarely there and have no clue as to what is actually going on, who is doing the work&quot;</li><li>&quot;I feel valued and my work is personally fulfilling and recognized by my immediate supervisor, students, and colleagues.&quot;</li><li>&quot;I would rate KCC as the worst college I have had the opportunity to be&#160;<em>[sic]</em>employed.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Work environment is one of the best I have worked in my entire working career.&#160; We all work as a team here at KCC.&quot;</li></ul><p>In my next article, I will share a bit more analysis from this portion of the survey.&#160;I hope, though, the quoted feedback I've provided here show you how challenging it is to completely understand the results of our recent Employee Satisfaction Survey.&#160;There's a lot of passion expressed here, and that passion is often aimed in opposite directions.&#160;</p><p>Finally, thanks for reading this first blog-style update to the college community.&#160; Stay tuned.</p><p>Best,<br>MB<br></p></div>

<div><b>Article Content:</b> <p>​Thank you to everyone who participated in the Noel Levitz Employee Satisfaction Survey. In total, 339 KCC employees received the survey and 141 responded to it.</p><p>Overall, respondents ranked their satisfaction with the workplace at a 4.02 out of 5.0.&#160; This is higher than the average comparison group of institutions score of 3.84.</p><p>&quot;KCC conducts this survey so that we can continue to improve, even in areas where we are already outperforming other employers,&quot; said Dr. Boyd. &quot;KCC, as it has in each year of the survey's administration, outperformed similar institutions in overall satisfaction which means that employees at KCC are generally more satisfied than employees at other colleges. This is great news and an indicator that Kankakee Community College remains a great place to work.&#160;A quick review of those items where KCC improved since the last survey are great reminders of the pride employees have in this college's mission and our impact in the community.&quot;</p><p>&#160;<br><strong>Strengths</strong><br>Employees feel&#58;<br></p><ul><li>Proud to work at this institution, feel their work is personally rewarding, and feel&#160;appreciated by their supervisor.</li><li>The institution treats students as its top priority and promotes excellent employee-student relationships.</li><li>The institution treats students as its top priority and promotes excellent employee-student relationships.<br></li><li>Themselves personally, and the institution are committed to advocating for equality and inclusion for all groups, <br>particularly LGBTQ, Multicultural, women, veterans, first generations students, and students with disabilities.</li><li>The institution has done an effective job making them aware of its policies, procedures, and available resources.</li><li>The benefits available to them are valuable.</li></ul><p></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong>On the upswing</strong><br>Areas which showed significant improvement compared to the 2018 survey&#58;</p><ul><li>The institution is committed to advocating for equality and inclusion for all groups.</li><li>The institution is committed for fostering a community of inclusion that promotes equality and acceptance for all students and all employees.</li><li>Faculty take pride in their work.</li><li>The institution is well-respected in the community.</li><li>There are effective lines of communication between departments.</li><li>There is good communication between the faculty and the administration at this institution.</li><li>Efforts to improve quality are paying off at this institution.</li><li>The leadership of this institution has a clear sense of purpose.&#160;</li></ul><p><strong>Opportunities for Improvement</strong><br>Employees feel the institution could improve by&#58;</p><ul><li>Exploring ways to retain the most highly qualified employees and providing additional opportunities for advancement.</li><li>Increasing effective lines of communication between departments and using employee suggestions to improve the institution.</li><li>Increasing efforts to promote positive employee morale.</li><li>Consistently following clear processes for the selection of new employees.</li><li>Ensuring that departments have the staff necessary to do their jobs well.</li></ul><p><strong>Aspirations</strong><br>Employees ranked the following as the top five strategic priorities the institution should pursue&#58;<br>1.

      <description><![CDATA[<div><b>Article Description:</b> Press Release from IDES on Unemployment Fraud</div>
<div><b>Article Category:</b> Update (Faculty and Staff Newsletter)</div>

<div><b>Article Image:</b> <img alt="" height="205" src="/PublishingImages/Update/HRNews.jpg" width="200" style="BORDER: 0px solid; "></div>
<div><b>Article Content:</b> <div><strong>Identity Theft-Related Unemployment Fraud</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div>The following is a press release from the&#160;Illinois Department of Employment Security (IDES).</div><div><br></div><div>IDES is&#160;urging Illinoisans to be on high alert for phishing schemes that may be leading to identity theft as international bad actors continue to attempt to exploit unemployment systems across the country. Fraudulent text messages, emails, and social media messages, posing as IDES and other state agencies and constitutional offices, are being sent to individuals in an attempt to phish for personally identifiable information (PII) and other data. This is a continued, organized attempt to defraud state unemployment insurance systems until the expiration of the federal unemployment programs on September 4, 2021.<br></div><div><br></div><div>It is imperative that claimants and the public at large remain vigilant to detect fraudulent correspondence. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has provided steps individuals should follow to recognize and avoid phishing schemes. Individuals should also take steps to strengthen and protect online account information. IDES claimants should maintain strong, unique passwords to their accounts, and never share personal account information with untrustworthy sources.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Since March 2020, IDES has shut down more than 1.7 million claims filed with the Department in the names of identity theft victims. Throughout the pandemic, these organized and sophisticated crime syndicates have continued to adapt and evolve their attempts to access the unemployment insurance system. IDES has worked tirelessly to enhance internal analytic tools, fraud detection and prevention methods, and identity verification measures to increase protections around fraudsters accessing the system and filing fraudulent claims. Last week alone, the State of Illinois and IDES networks blocked nearly 450 million nefarious attempts to access the Department’s benefit system, either to file a fraudulent unemployment insurance claim or to compromise an existing claimant account to redirect payment.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Illinois is among the states who have committed to administering the federal unemployment insurance programs until their expiration in September to ensure those who are struggling receive the benefits they eligible for under federal law. These programs include Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA), Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (FPUC), and Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation (PEUC). As expected, fraudsters are increasing their attempts to access the unemployment insurance systems in states who have not opted out of administering these programs early. This is being done through continued data mining via phishing schemes to attempt to file claims in the names of identity theft victims or steal benefits from existing claimants.</div><div><br></div><div>Identity theft-related unemployment insurance fraud has been rampant nationwide since the onset of the pandemic as a result of the wide-scale availability of PII and the creation and extensions of the federal unemployment insurance programs – PUA, FPUC, and PEUC. Large corporate data breaches and cyber hacks (e.g. Equifax data breach in 2017 which compromised the PII of nearly 150 million; Yahoo data breach in 2014 which compromised the PII of nearly 3 billion; Target data breach in 2013 which compromised the PII of nearly 110 million) have exposed and compromised the PII of millions of victims, resulting in organized fraudsters taking advantage of this information and using it to capitalize monetarily during a time of crisis.<br></div><div><br></div><div><strong>If you have been the victim of identity theft-related unemployment insurance fraud, visit the IDES fraud webpage for information about how to report the claim.</strong><br></div></div>

While we do have clear direction from the Governor's office, plans like this are subject to change.&quot;</p><p>The moment we knew that vaccinations were available we offered our campus as a distribution site,&quot; said Dr. Boyd. &quot;KCC is a familiar place for so many residents and that's why it was a great place to host a vaccination site. It's our hope is that all residents in Kankakee County who qualify for the vaccine can receive it. It is a privilege to serve our community during the COVID-19 recovery process.&quot;</p><p>A preparation team is working on the details, including the set-up, signage and communication.

<div><b>Article Content:</b> <p>​Advisors titles are changing from Academic Advisor to Student Success Advisors.&#160;<br></p><p>&quot;Over time,&#160;advisors roles have expanded to include more than planning student's schedules and registering them for classes,&quot; said Meredith Purcell, director of&#160;advising. &quot;We also connect students to campus resources like tutoring, counseling and social work services, plan events and contribute to student success initiatives.&quot;<br></p><p>Advisors plan and oversee events that help students during their educational journey, including Cav Days, New Student Orientation, career exploration workshops and the Spring/Fall transfer fairs.

full-time employees, current adjunct instructors, and part-time employees
averaging 16 hours or more of work per week to complete an employee
satisfaction survey.&#160; The deadine has been extended to allow those 47 employees who have started the survey additional time to complete it.&#160; And&#160;&#160;If you haven't started it as of yet, you also have additonal time to start and finish&#160;it.&#160;&#160;</span></em><br></p><p><em><span style="background&#58;yellow;font-family&#58;calibri, sans-serif;font-style&#58;normal;">Here is the

sometime in April.</span></em></p><p><em><span style="font-family&#58;calibri, sans-serif;font-style&#58;normal;">Here are questions and answers related to the survey,

offering an incentive for the completion of THIS survey only (not to be
precedent setting for other surveys).&#160;Upon completion of the survey, you
will be given the opportunity to print off a coupon for a medium size coffee or
a bottled soda pop (Approx. $2.00 value) redeemable at Arena Food
Services.&#160; Additionally, if you put your name on the bottom of the coupon,
you will be entered into a second incentive where we will draw four names with
each person winning a $25 Wal-Mart gift certificate</span>.&#160;<span style="color&#58;#1f497d;"></span></p><p><em><span style="font-family&#58;calibri, sans-serif;font-style&#58;normal;">As always, thank you in advance for your

</p><p>The final stages of the website software migration will go live at kcc.edu the week of March 8.</p><p>The changes include a new homepage and updated Student Affairs site. The rest of the site is now also part of a new web management system. The implementation has been a collaboration between the Marketing Department and Information Technology Services since 2018.</p><p> <img src="/PublishingImages/Kankakee%20Community%20College%20sm-1.png" class="ms-rtePosition-2" alt="" style="margin&#58;10px;" /> &quot;The software we were using is no longer supported, and we knew we had to make a move.&quot; said Kari Nugent, director of marketing and public relations.&#160; </p><p>After researching the options, the team chose powerful, low-cost, open-source products for web management, instead of typical content management software. </p><p>&quot;What we did was truly innovative,&quot; Kari said. &quot;Not many other colleges or universities are doing this yet, but they want to. These products are flexible and scalable, so they will grow as we do. We were also able to update our content, navigation and design. It's not often that a college significantly alters all of these at once.&quot;<br></p><p>The team used research to refine navigation and tested the results with KCC students. 
   <br></p><p> 
   <strong>Here are some highlights of the site&#58;</strong></p><ul><li>The focus is on the visitor's experience</li><li>It takes fewer clicks to find important information about the programs KCC offers, the cost to attend, and how to apply for financial aid.</li><li>Inquiry information funnels directly to Student Affairs, where recruiters and advisors follow up. </li><li>Bigger and bolder pictures/banners</li><li>For the most part, the site is now organized by topic instead of audience. </li><li>The look and feel is more modern.</li></ul><p>
  Several&#160;sub-sites within kcc.edu launched between May 2018 and now. Those sites include Athletics, news and events,&#160;KCC Foundation, Adult and Community Education, Library, Workforce Investment and Opportunity Act and Corporate and Continuing Education. </p><p>Anyone with questions about the process is invited to phone or email me at ext. 8256 or&#160;<a href="mailto&#58;knugent@kcc.edu">knugent@kcc.edu</a>.<br></p></div>

<div><b>Article Content:</b> <p>​Congratulations to KCC's&#160;Women's Basketball Coach Donnie Denson on reaching 500 career&#160;wins! Below is an article and photo&#160;reprinted from the Daily Journal.&#160;<br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Women's College Basketball&#58; Denson gets career win No. 500 with KCC's win over Bethel<br></strong>Cody Smith | csmith@daily-journal.com<br>Jan. 27, 2021</p><p><span class="print_trim" style="background-color&#58;#ffffff;color&#58;#000000;font-family&#58;manuale, serif;box-sizing&#58;border-box;">KANKAKEE —</span><span style="background-color&#58;#ffffff;color&#58;#000000;font-family&#58;manuale, serif;">&#160;Kankakee Community College women’s basketball coach Donnie Denson came into the season knowing the Cavaliers’ first win would be a monumental one, as he entered the season with 499 career wins.</span></p><p><span style="background-color&#58;#ffffff;color&#58;#000000;font-family&#58;manuale, serif;"></span><span style="background-color&#58;#ffffff;color&#58;#000000;font-family&#58;manuale, serif;">It didn’t take long for Denson to reach his milestone.</span></p><p><span style="background-color&#58;#ffffff;color&#58;#000000;font-family&#58;manuale, serif;">Thanks to a gigantic run to close out the fourth quarter, KCC defeated Bethel University JV 89-68 in the Cavaliers’ home opener to give Denson his 500th college victory and improve the team to 1-1 on the year.</span></p><p><span style="background-color&#58;#ffffff;color&#58;#000000;font-family&#58;manuale, serif;"></span><span style="background-color&#58;#ffffff;color&#58;#000000;font-family&#58;manuale, serif;">“It’s been a journey,” Denson said. “I think about all the players who went through our program and what they went on to do … it kind of makes you think of all the relationships I’ve built with players over the years.”</span></p><p><span style="background-color&#58;#ffffff;color&#58;#000000;font-family&#58;manuale, serif;"></span><span style="background-color&#58;#ffffff;color&#58;#000000;font-family&#58;manuale, serif;">In Denson’s 21 years of coaching at KCC, he has recorded an official college coaching record of 500-150, a .770 win percentage, with 16 of those seasons netting at least 20 wins.</span></p><p><span style="background-color&#58;#ffffff;color&#58;#000000;font-family&#58;manuale, serif;"></span><span style="background-color&#58;#ffffff;color&#58;#000000;font-family&#58;manuale, serif;">“I haven’t really slowed down enough to really think about No. 500,” Denson said. “I guess it’s just going to take some time for it all to soak in.”</span></p><p><span style="background-color&#58;#ffffff;color&#58;#000000;font-family&#58;manuale, serif;"></span><span style="background-color&#58;#ffffff;color&#58;#000000;font-family&#58;manuale, serif;">The reason Denson was able to achieve this new career milestone was in part because of the brilliant offensive performance by sophomore guard Brandi Hudson.</span></p><p><span style="background-color&#58;#ffffff;color&#58;#000000;font-family&#58;manuale, serif;">Hudson poured in 23 of her team-high 25 points in the first half, which helped KCC take a comfortable 14-point lead into halftime. From there, Hudson forced Bethel to make stopping her a focal point, which in turn allowed Hudson to become more of a playmaker for her teammates in the second half.</span></p><p><span style="background-color&#58;#ffffff;color&#58;#000000;font-family&#58;manuale, serif;"></span><span style="background-color&#58;#ffffff;color&#58;#000000;font-family&#58;manuale, serif;">“To be honest the defense was kind of open, especially in the first half,” Hudson said. “I’m so used to reading the defense so I can break through it easily. And that’s what teams fail to realize.”</span></p><p><span style="background-color&#58;#ffffff;color&#58;#000000;font-family&#58;manuale, serif;">Between Hudson’s offensive onslaught and KCC’s ability to force 20+ turnovers off its full-court press during the contest, KCC managed to avoid a Bethel comeback, which was sparked by an 18-5 Bethel run to close out the third quarter.</span></p><p><span style="background-color&#58;#ffffff;color&#58;#000000;font-family&#58;manuale, serif;"></span><span style="background-color&#58;#ffffff;color&#58;#000000;font-family&#58;manuale, serif;">KCC then opened things up again in the fourth quarter with tenacity. The Cavaliers went back to their full-court press, which forced a pair of Bethel turnovers to open the frame. The Cavaliers were able to get easy scores on the offensive end, which helped them build a 66-56 lead with just eight minutes left in the game.</span></p><p><span style="background-color&#58;#ffffff;color&#58;#000000;font-family&#58;manuale, serif;">“Our energy just went back from being negative and </span><span style="background-color&#58;#ffffff;color&#58;#000000;font-family&#58;manuale, serif;">down to, boom, creating three to four positive plays in a row, and that just gave us energy the rest of the way,” Denson said.</span></p><p><span style="background-color&#58;#ffffff;color&#58;#000000;font-family&#58;manuale, serif;">The defensive energy helped KCC close out the fourth quarter on a gigantic 23-12 run to close things out.</span></p><p><span style="background-color&#58;#ffffff;color&#58;#000000;font-family&#58;manuale, serif;"></span><span style="background-color&#58;#ffffff;color&#58;#000000;font-family&#58;manuale, serif;">“Tonight’s game we stayed in a press because we feel it provides us the best opportunity to take away possessions and gain,” Denson said. “It also keeps us engaged and keeps our energy up.”</span></p><p><span style="background-color&#58;#ffffff;color&#58;#000000;font-family&#58;manuale, serif;">Aside from Hudson’s big contribution, KCC got additional support from starters Madison Allen (19 points), Jaida Sherrod (14 points) and T’Laizha Morris (9 points).</span></p><p><span style="background-color&#58;#ffffff;color&#58;#000000;font-family&#58;manuale, serif;">“We saw great positives tonight compared to last Friday’s game, but we still had little bit of segments where we have corrections to make,” Denson said.</span></p><p><span style="background-color&#58;#ffffff;color&#58;#000000;font-family&#58;manuale, serif;"></span></p></div>

<div><b>Article Content:</b> <p>With ongoing budget challenges, and uncertainty over state and federal funding levels, the College has been attempting to reduce costs in order to maintain as much continuity as possible in our services and programs.&#160; We are continuing to explore ways to achieve cost reductions through voluntary measures in order to avoid, or at least to minimize, the need for any involuntary reductions. As part of these efforts, a One-Time Voluntary Retirement Program is being offered for eligible employees. The eligibility requirements, participation conditions, and separation incentive are outlined below. <span class="ms-rteForeColor-2">This one-time offering will expire today,&#160;January 5, 2021.&#160;</span></p><p><span style="text-decoration&#58;underline;"><strong>Eligibility Requirements</strong></span></p><p>In order to be eligible to participate in the One-Time Voluntary Retirement Program, the following conditions must be met&#58;</p><ol style="list-style-type&#58;decimal;"><li>The employee shall have a minimum of ten (10) years of continuous, full-time service at the College by the intended date of retirement; and</li><li>The employee must have an effective separation date sometime between March 1, 2021 and December 31, 2021; and</li><li>The employee must be eligible to retire under the rules and regulations of the State Universities Retirement System (SURS) without any additional costs to the College as a result of excess earnings increases (over 6%) in any academic year used by SURS to determine the employee's final rate of earnings.&#160;</li></ol><p><span style="text-decoration&#58;underline;"><strong>One-Time Voluntary Retirement Program Incentive</strong></span><strong>&#160;</strong></p><p><strong></strong>An employee approved for the program shall receive&#58;</p><p>1)&#160;a one-time retirement payment of $8,100 to the retiree on their final paycheck (the approximate equivalent of 18 months of premium) for personal health insurance through the College Insurance Program provided through SURS or through another insurance provider.&#160; &#160;</p><p>2)&#160;The employee will also be paid any other amounts owed or required by law or College policy (e.g., unused vacation days).</p><p>3)&#160;In no event shall the incentive be calculated or applied so as to cause a participant's earnings to exceed SURS limits and/or cause the College to owe any additional contributions, payments or penalties to SURS.&#160; The College reserves the right to make adjustments to the incentive in order to avoid the assessment of any additional contributions, payments or penalties by SURS.&#160;</p><p><span style="text-decoration&#58;underline;"><strong>Participation Conditions</strong></span></p><p>In order to participate in the One-Time Voluntary Retirement Program, the following steps must be taken&#58;</p><ol style="list-style-type&#58;decimal;"><li><strong>By no later than January 5, 2021, the employee must complete an application </strong>(see HR to receive it) indicating interest in the program and identifying the intended separation date (which must be between March 1, 2021 and December 31, 2021 and participating faculty must complete their current semester/term as not to adversely affect our students).&#160; </li><li>Once the application is received, the College will prepare a separation agreement that will include your Retirement Incentive, your separation date, and other legal conditions. The employee must execute this separation agreement and release. </li><li>We will consider the needs of the College in order to minimize the disruption on College operations and to maximize the amount of savings that are generated by this One-Time Voluntary Retirement Program.&#160; The final separation date will be set forth in the separation agreement and depending on the response to the One-Time Voluntary Retirement Program, the College reserves the right to propose a separation date beyond the December 31, 2021 deadline. </li><li>The employee's participation in the One-Time Voluntary Retirement Program and the separation agreement must be approved by the Board of Trustees.&#160; As it is impossible to gauge the level of response to this One-Time Voluntary Retirement Program before formally receiving applications, the College reserves the right to limit the number of approved participants.&#160; The final decision as to whether a participant is approved by the Board of Trustees rests with the sole discretion of the Board.&#160;</li></ol><p>Please note that the ultimate decision whether to retire from the College is significant and should be carefully considered before applying for participation in this One-Time Voluntary Retirement Program.<br></p><p>Anyone with questions, please contact David at ext. 8128.<br></p></div>

<div><b>Article Category:</b> Update (Faculty and Staff Newsletter)</div>
<div><b>Article Thumbnail:</b> <img alt="" src="/PublishingImages/Update/Computer150x150.jpg" style="BORDER: 0px solid; "></div>
<div><b>Article Content:</b> <p>​KCC is moving to a new software solution to manage and edit the KCC website.</p><p>The project is entering the stage where content still on the &quot;legacy&quot; software (Sharepoint) moves to the new software (CloudCannon). This move will occur from now through Jan. 31. During this time, please use the <a href="https&#58;//form.jotform.com/KCCwebservices/request">Web Services Request</a> form to request changes to all KCC web pages. If you have questions about it, contact&#160;Roger Ehmpke at <a href="mailto&#58;rehmpke@kcc.edu">rehmpke@kcc.edu</a>.<br></p><p>As mentioned above, the bulk of the migration will occur between now and Jan. 31, 2021. While the move is underway, the web team will make critical changes and will delay the more routine updates until after Feb. 1.</p><p>The implementation of a new web software management system has been a collaboration between the Marketing Department and Information Technology Services since 2018.</p><p>&quot;The software that we are transitioning from is outdated and no longer supported,&quot; said Kari Nugent, director of marketing and public relations. &quot;The need to make a change gave us the opportunity to develop a new web site that focuses on the user's experience. The team has been working hard to update content, navigation and design. It's not often that a college gets the chance to impact all three at once.&quot;</p><p>The new site has a more modern look and feel. Several&#160; sub-sites within it have already launched, including Athletics, news and events,&#160;catalog,&#160;KCC Foundation, Adult and Community Education, Library, Workforce Investment and Opportunity Act and Corporate and Continuing Education. Next, Student Affairs sites and the homepage will go live in early 2021.<br></p><p>Anyone with questions about the process is invited to phone or email me at ext. 8256 or <a href="mailto&#58;knugent@kcc.edu">knugent@kcc.edu</a>.<br></p></div>

<div><b>Article Content:</b> <p>​Though additional options have been made available by the Centers for Disease Control, Kankakee Community College has elected to continue requiring a 14-day quarantine following exposure to COVID-19 before an individual can return to college facilities.</p><p>&quot;Throughout the pandemic, KCC has worked closely with the Kankakee County Health Department to ensure that our practices and policies were in line with their recommendations,&quot; said Kate Wachtor from the college's reopening taskforce. &quot;KCC is a congregate setting and there is still a risk of residual post-quarantine transmission when the quarantine is less than 14 days. KCHD has advised the college to continue to adhere to the 14 day quarantine time frame. By maintaining a 14-day quarantine requirement, we further reduce or eliminate that risk.&quot;</p><p>Anyone with questions can reach out to Kate&#160;at ext. 8524.<br></p></div>

<div><b>Article Content:</b> <p>The Physical Plant Department is reviewing our campus key program and want to ensure that the keys you have been issued are the keys you need, and have.&#160; The reason for this verification is to update our records and your card file as staff have relocated offices, or departments over time.&#160; Please contact Aliso Sublett to find out what keys we currently have on record for you.&#160; We&#160;will work with you to correct your records.&#160; Going forward keys will not be transferred directly between staff members.&#160; All keys, including file cabinet keys and equipment keys, should be returned to the PPD office and issued directly to the new holder. <strong>The deadline for key verification is December 22, 2020</strong>.<br></p><p>Beginning January 4, 2021, we will be making some adjustments to our key issuing program.&#160; At that time we will assume our records are up-to-date and will charge the $5.00 per key cutting fee for any keys lost or not returned when staff members leave KCC.&#160; Damaged keys should be reported to the PPD office immediately and a replacement will be issued at no fee.<br></p><p>Feel free to return any unused keys at any time and we will remove them from your record.&#160; Please email Alison Sublett at <a href="mailto&#58;asublett@kcc.edu">asublett@kcc.edu</a> or call&#160;8174 to set up a 10-15 minute block to review and update your key card file when you're on campus and available.&#160; We are looking forward to hearing from everyone and will do our&#160;best to make this process as simple as possible.<br></p><p><br></p></div>

and many can’t wait to get into the new year hoping for the better.<span>&#160; </span>But there is some good news to share with you
this holiday season&#58; due to the banks being closed on Friday, January 1, 2021 (with
their next business day being on Monday, Jan 4, 2021) <span style="text-decoration&#58;underline;">we need to pay our employees
on Thursday, Dec. 31</span>.<span>&#160; </span>That means
there will be a total of 27 paychecks in 2020.<span>&#160;
</span>With one more paycheck, our employees will be earning more in 2020.<span>&#160; </span>In 2021, there will be the normal 26
payrolls, meaning your W-2 wages will actually be less next year.<span>&#160; </span>The 12/31/20 paycheck will <strong>NOT</strong> have
any medical, dental, additional voluntary life insurance, FLEX, or United Way
&amp; Employee Giving taken out of it, but it <strong>WILL</strong> have SURS, Medicare,
FICA, buy-up long term disability, and any other normal deductions associated
with earnings.<span>&#160; </span></span></p><p><span style="color&#58;#111111;font-family&#58;&quot;helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;">If anyone is concerned about tax implications
this year, you can always change the number of withholdings by opening the

All departments and employees are invited to bring items for drop off, and to come get supplies they might be able to use for KCC work. Items can be gently worn, but still need to be usable.</p><p><img src="/PublishingImages/Office%20supplies%20sm.JPG" class="ms-rtePosition-1" alt="" style="margin&#58;5px;" />Already available&#58; desk trays, binders or file folders (letter and legal size available) and some other assorted items. Please check it out before you purchase new items.<br></p><p>Room L251 is on the second floor, near the center of the L Building. It is to the east of the Media Department and West of Admin Hall. </p><p>The room will be open when Liz Becvar is on Riverfront Campus (at this time&#58; three days per week). If the room is closed, feel free to contact security or someone from Physical Plant Department to open the door.</p><p>After each semester, any items still remaining will be moved to storage for auction.</p><p>And, one last time, please remember that you should only take items that are going to be used for KCC work.</p><p>Anyone with questions about the office exchange can contact Liz Becvar at x8253 or <a href="mailto&#58;ebecvar@kcc.edu">ebecvar@kcc.edu</a>.<br></p><p><br></p></div>

<div><b>Article Content:</b> <p>The fifth president of KCC, Dr. Girard Weber, died Wednesday, Nov. 11 at the age of 70. Weber was KCC's president from July 1, 2001 to April 4, 2009.</p><p>Upon announcing his departure from KCC, Weber said &quot;It's been a pleasure working at KCC for the past seven years. KCC is poised for the future with a philosophy of continuous quality improvement and with state leadership in sustainability and renewable energy.&quot;</p><p>He left KCC to become president at College of Lake County in Grayslake, where he served from April 2009 to June 2017. He then accepted the presidency at Bellevue College in Washington, where he worked from July 2017 to March 2020. </p><p>At KCC, Weber lead the college through many successful initiatives and fulfilled several goals set by the board of trustees, including the adoption of Academic Quality Improvement Program (AQIP) as an accreditation and planning vehicle. In 2002, the college completed a community-wide strategic planning process, which resulted in a 20-year master facilities plan for the college. While Weber was president, the college opened a Satellite Center in Watseka (2003) and the Education and Employment Center in downtown Kankakee (2007). The college's Riverfront Campus in Kankakee opened a Workforce Development Center (2003), an Arts and Sciences facility (2007), and the Health Careers Center for Excellence (2008).</p><p>&quot;Dr. Jerry Weber was a catalyst for change and a champion for sustainability,&quot; said KCC president Dr. Michael Boyd. &quot;Jerry started the conversation on our campus about sustainability, and our focus on sustainable and renewable energy training is part of the legacy he left here at KCC. After his departure, the college carried on with that priority. He and I spent some time together a few weeks ago. Jerry visited campus and he toured the renovated Miner Memorial Library and the new Advanced Technology Education Center, which was built to deliver KCC's renewable energy curriculum. I could tell how proud he was of ATEC, even though it occurred after his time at KCC had ended. He made a lasting impact on our campus.&quot;</p><p>Weber earned a doctorate in higher education administration and a master's degree in educational measurement and statistics from the University of Iowa. He has had two degrees from Northern Illinois University, a master's degree in linguistics and English literature, and a bachelor's degree in English.<br></p></div>

<div><b>Article Content:</b> <p>Following is a summary of topics addressed at KCC's Board of Trustees meeting, Nov. 9, 2020</p><p><strong>Introduction of Guests. </strong>The Board heard comments from the Faculty Association regarding proposed personnel policy revisions.</p><p><strong>Action Items. </strong>The Board approved the following&#58;</p><ul><li>Tuition/course reimbursements</li><li>Grant awards</li><li>Request to bid an autoclave and building renovations for an Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Center.</li><li>First reading of new personnel policies and revisions</li></ul><p><strong>President's Report.</strong> Dr. Boyd said…</p><ul><li>Nursing reaccreditation was affirmed. Appreciation goes to Sheri Cagle and the nursing faculty for their work on it.</li><li>Phi Theta Kappa hosted an induction ceremony for 35 students.

We are working closely with the Kankakee Health Department to plan for the scenarios, but several details have to be determined before we would go forward with options. &#160;</li><li>A one-day power outage on West Campus is planned so that ComEd can complete upgrades to the power system.</li><li>With the surge of Covid-19 cases nationally, faculty will begin to wrap-up in-person learning and encourage students to complete the semester remotely.</li><li>We are planning a phased-in reopening plan starting Jan. 19, and we are conscious of doing this safely. We will monitor the Covid-19 situation as plans continue. Our priority is to keep everyone healthy.</li></ul><p><strong>Trustee's Report. </strong>Dick Frey said…</p><ul><li>The next ICCTA meeting takes place in November via Zoom.</li></ul><p><strong>Student Trustee's Report. </strong>Ariana Ramirez said …</p><ul><li>SAC's Halloween event hosted on KCC's Student Life Facebook page generated engagement, likes and shares.</li><li>Spill the Tea with the Trustee happened virtually and garnered positive feedback.</li><li>First generation college student celebration is being held this week.</li><li>PTK held an socially-distanced induction ceremony, conducted an &quot;I can go to college&quot; project, and held their 3rd annual sleep out.</li><li>Clubs are meeting virtually.<br></li></ul></div>

If we all participate, we can make a difference for students and&#160;members of our community. Plus, you could receive a day off work with pay, and other incentives depending on your commitment level.</p><p>You understand the challenges of our students in ways that others cannot. Your giving is powerful, but it is especially meaningful this year. It is a time when students and the community need support more than ever.&#160;</p><p>In a video,&#160;KCC President Dr. Michael Boyd said, &quot;We'll need&#160;to&#160;continue focusing on the needs of the students we serve. Students who may be facing challenges far more complex than each of us face.&quot;&#160;Take a moment to view&#160;<a href="https&#58;//foundation.kcc.edu/give/employee-giving/"><strong class="ms-rteForeColor-8">Dr. Boyd's message</strong></a><strong class="ms-rteForeColor-8">.&#160;</strong></p><p>You can decide how your donation is used. Choose options to impact student-focused initiatives through the KCC Foundation and community-minded support through United Way - or both. Any amount is the right size, and we have incentives for every level of giving.&#160;</p><p>If you are new to KCC, please consider how you would like to give back. If you have been at KCC for a while, we hope you can maintain or slightly increase your gift from last year. Or, maybe it is the right time to give for the first time. Every contribution makes a difference!&#160;</p><p>Many of us made contributions during the KCC Foundation's Give Day. That effort was fantastic! The need remains as we begin this annual employee campaign to support&#160;students and the community.&#160;</p><p>For many students, we are their support. They don't have reliable transportation, or reliable internet, or help parenting, or a warm meal every day. They are working, studying and being parents. Your support of these campaigns makes things a bit better for them. It will definitely make a difference! &#160;</p><p>Please&#160;<a href="https&#58;//foundation.kcc.edu/give/employee-giving/"><strong class="ms-rteForeColor-8">give</strong></a>&#160;today.</p><p>Thank you!<br></p><p><br></p></div>

<div><b>Article Content:</b> <p>Dr. Francesca Catalano and Pat Klette recently presented at the <a href="https&#58;//icsps.illinoisstate.edu/cte/forum-for-excellence">Forum&#160;for Excellence</a>, held Sept. 23 and 24.<br></p><p>Their&#160;topic was&#160;&quot;Rethinking the Purpose of Gen Ed Courses in CTE Programs.&quot; The online presentation was seen by&#160;more than&#160;80 faculty and administrators from throughout the state.<br></p><p>Here's a&#160;the program description (edited for clarity within this context)&#58;</p><p>&quot;KCC Career and Technical Education&#160;leadership asked the question, 'What are the purposes of Gen Eds in CTE programs?'&#160;This led us to revise the general education CTE programmatic requirements and reconfigure them into a guided pathway to ensure students take general education course when appropriate. In particular, we redesigned the Technical Math and Technical Science courses for this cohort so they are no longer applicable as general education courses for the AA/AS degrees.<br> <br>&quot;We designed the competencies for the Technical Math and Technical Science classes so that they support and complement each other. The course objectives for Technical Math align with PWR Act. The Technical Science class was designed by science faculty with extensive collaboration from the CTE faculty and local industry. It will cover all topics that have been identified within these fields and include guest speakers and field trips to local employers.&quot;<br></p><p>Pat is program coordinator of Electrical Engineering Technology Programs;&#160;Francesca is associate dean of the Math, Science and Engineering Division.<br></p><p>The Forum for Excellence is a Career and Technical Education and Adult Education professional development event. According to the Illinois Center for Specialized Professional Support&#160;website, it &quot;highlights educational initiatives and effective practices impacting career pathway implementatiaon and expansion.&quot;<br></p></div>

<div><b>Article Content:</b> <p>​</p><p>The Physical Plant Department is reviewing our campus key program and want to ensure that the keys you have been issued are the keys you need, and have.&#160; The reason for this verification is to update our records and your card file as staff have relocated offices, or departments over time.&#160; Please contact Alison Sublett&#160;to find out what keys we currently have on record for you.&#160; I will work with you to correct your records.&#160; Going forward keys will not be transferred directly between staff members.&#160; All keys, including file cabinet keys and equipment keys, should be returned to the PPD office and issued directly to the new holder. <strong>The deadline for key verification is December 22, 2020</strong>. <br></p><p>Beginning January 4, 2021, we will be making some adjustments to our key issuing program.&#160; At that time we will assume our records are up-to-date and will charge the $5.00 per key cutting fee for any keys lost or not returned when staff members leave KCC.&#160; Damaged keys should be reported to the PPD office immediately and a replacement will be issued at no fee.<br></p><p>Feel free to return any unused keys to PPD at any time and we will remove them from your record.&#160; Please email me at asublett@kcc.edu&#160;or call&#160;8174 to set up a 10-15 minute block to review and update your key card file when you're on campus and available.&#160; We&#160;am looking forward to hearing from everyone and will do my best to make this process as simple as possible.<br></p><p><br></p></div>

<div><b>Article Content:</b> <p>As we get closer to the fall semester, we are all preparing to be as safe as we can on campus. Occasionally, we may come across someone who isn't wearing a mask. We've put together a <a href="http&#58;//www.kcc.edu/FacultyStaff/update/Documents/masks%20required%20flyer_2020%20revised.pdf" target="_blank">flier</a> with suggested phrases to help you initiate conversations with visitors, colleagues or students who are not wearing masks while in the building.&#160;</p><p>It is college policy that masks must be worn at all times by anyone on campus even when practicing social distancing with the exception of employees working in their private offices. Anyone entering the building without a mask will be given one if they need one.&#160;</p><p>As a reminder, if someone has a medical reason for not wearing a mask, they could receive an accommodation with proper documentation. Visitors will discuss their accommodations with campus security at the entrance, students should talk with Sherry Kinzler in Student Affairs and employees should consult with David Cagle in Human Resources. </p><p>If someone is simply refusing to wear a mask, you may ask them to put one on. If he/she refuses, they will be asked to leave the building and the incident will be reported to Meredith Purcell in Student Services and to Eric Springer in Campus Security for possible Code of Conduct violations.&#160;</p><p>The pandemic has posed some real challenges for all of us and KCC's mask policy is &#160;to keep everyone as safe as possible while they are on campus. If you have any questions, please contact David Cagle at ext. 8128.</p><p>&#160;</p><p><br></p></div>

<div><b>Article Content:</b> <p>As more employees transition back to working on campus, and as the college begins to meet with students via appointments beginning Monday, June 15, it is important for us to remember our &quot;Proper Dress&quot; policy, which is described below&#58;&#160; </p><h2>Proper Dress </h2><p>Employees should recognize that as representatives of the College they are judged not only by the service they render and their actions toward students and the public, but also by their personal appearance. In order to help make a positive impression, the College requests that employees dress appropriately for the position in which they work, and that their attire be neat and clean.&#160; Generally speaking, <strong>all employees of the college should be wearing professional business attire</strong>.&#160; </p><p>Should you have any questions on the above policy, please contact David in HR at ext. 8128.&#160;&#160;<br></p></div>

<div><b>Article Content:</b> Colleagues,<div>In the days since the events which occurred on May 25th&#160;leading to the death of George Floyd, we have all experienced a range of emotions.&#160; As we grieve together, each in our own way, we also make a commitment to support and care for one another.&#160; At KCC, we are committed to nurturing and sustaining a culture of caring because we know that the learning process begins with caring deeply about others as human beings.</div><div>Right now, we need listen to each other, learn from each other, and commit to doing so peacefully.&#160; Throughout history, peaceful protests have helped us learn more about each other, the unique challenges each of us faces, and ways to overcome those challenges together.&#160; Racism is a very real societal problem; it is systemic and harmful to everyone.&#160; Each one of us has an important moral obligation to do whatever we can to overcome racism and the impact it has on our communities.&#160; Sadly, George Floyd's tragic death is not an isolated incident.&#160; His death and the death of others serves to illuminate the physical and psychological violence caused by systemic racism and injustice.</div><div>Our mission at KCC is so important to us because we truly believe that learning enhances quality of life for everyone.&#160; As educator Paulo Freire often wrote, education is an &quot;instrument of freedom.&quot;&#160; Peaceful gatherings, whether those gatherings are face to face or online, give us a unique opportunity to listen to each other and to learn.&#160; When we make a commitment to learning, we also make a commitment to our community.&#160; A diverse, equitable, inclusive community is a community that cares deeply about every single person regardless of the many superficial differences which feed ignorance, racism, and social injustice.</div><div>Please know that KCC is committed to providing a healthy, safe, and inclusive environment where everyone can learn.&#160; As we work through the powerful emotions associated with physical and psychological healing, we invite everyone to turn anger and fear into peaceful action, and make this moment a turning point for real change.&#160;<br><br>MB&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<br>&#160;<br>Dr. Michael Boyd</div><div>President<br></div><div><br>&#160;<br><br><p><br></p></div></div>

<div><b>Article Content:</b> <p>​It seems like just yesterday when I started going to KCC for my Associates Degree in Computer Programming. I worked in the library under Barb Loudy's direction as a student worker and enjoyed it so much that I started full-time in the Humanities/Social Science division right after graduation.<br></p><p>I have had the same position for 35 years, but I have had 9 bosses in that time. (I guess I'm hard on them. LOL) My office started in L337, moved to L340, and then ended up in L355.<br></p><p>My time at KCC has been wonderful and I will miss everyone. I received these flowers and plaque in the mail yesterday. Thanks to Katie and Liz for arranging for these to be sent to me and for the gift left at school for me.&#160;Since we were unable to have a retirement party, I thought I would use this to say goodbye to everyone. When everyone is allowed back on campus, I will be back for a visit to say goodbye in person.<br></p><p>Thanks to everyone who has wished me well. I am ready for this. I plan to do some work around the house and lots of work in my 2+ acres. It has all been put on the back burner for the last 10 years or so and needs a lot of TLC. Now it is time for that TLC. I also plan to do a lot of relaxing and dancing. I do already have a part-time job&#160;mowing--and not at my house; although, I will be doing that, too.<br></p><p>Until we meet again...<br></p></div>

<div><b>Article Content:</b> <p>As we enter Phase 3 of Governor Pritzker’s Reopen Illinois plan, KCC now has greater flexibility to welcome employees and students onto campus.&#160;&#160;</p><p>That said, clear restrictions remain in place, and some employees will continue to work from home until the governor determines when Illinois enters “Phase 4” of the state’s reopening plan. Supervisors will determine when employees need to access campus for essential functions and request that those employees get added to the security access list.&#160;</p><p>Our safety measures are still in place&#58;</p><div><ul><li>Once at KCC, masks are required to enter a college building.</li><li>Make sure there are 10 or fewer people in any given area.</li><li>Follow social distancing guidelines of 6 ft or more.&#160;</li></ul></div><p>In keeping with the plan guidelines, we will prepare for front line staff to return to campus beginning June 8 to meet with students on an appointment basis.</p><p>Supervisors will use the Phase 3 guidelines to create work schedules to accommodate student appointments. This includes advisors, financial aid staff, Business Office staff and any others who assist with advising and registration processes.</p><p>In addition to the safety requirements above, these additional measures will also be in place&#58;<br></p><div><ul><li>In-person student appointments will be optional. Virtual or phone appointments will continue.</li><li>Supervisors should make staffing plans based on who is needed, look at possibilities for use of a rotating schedule, and choose which work areas will be utilized.</li><li>The staffing plans will be shared with Physical Plant Department/Security to help custodians know which areas have people and need to be cleaned.</li></ul></div><p>Our vision statement at KCC says that we aim to be a “flexible organization where teamwork is the expectation,” and I continue to be impressed with our shared commitment to realize this bold vision.&#160;&#160;</p><p>Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we’ve all continued to demonstrate flexibility as we’ve encountered so many challenges.&#160;I ask you now to continue demonstrating flexibility.&#160; We’ve never had to “re-open” our campus in this way, and I know that we may make some mistakes along the way.&#160;But also know that we are committed to working as a team to figure it out, and we are going to do just that over the next weeks and months.<br></p></div>

<div><b>Article Content:</b> <p>Debra Daun is a adjunct instructor at KCC who is teaching ELTR2192&#160; Build a 3D Printer.&#160; She is also a Computer Graphic Technology tutor.&#160; However, she also is the MakerLab Manager at Joliet Junior College.</p><p>After discussions with Professor John Bordeau and the local maker community, the decision was made to produce mask shields for the growing demand of personnel protection equipment.&#160;&#160; </p><p>&quot;Debra is always ready to lend a helping hand and without hesitation stepped up when we were approached with this project,&quot; said Amy Murphy, JJC dean of applied arts, workforce education and training. &quot;I can't thank Debra enough for her efforts and sharing her expertise with the innovative technologies that are available in our JJC MakerLab.&quot;</p><p>Shields are made from PETG 3D printing filament, and each take about 40 minutes to complete. With its nine printers, the Maker Lab can make upwards of 100 shields per day. Affixed to a face mask, the shields can extend the life of the N95 masks.</p><p>As of Tuesday, &quot;She has made 1200 mask shields that have be donated to regional health care facilities such as Manteno Veterans Home.&#160; The demand is great and supplies in the country are sparse.&#160;&#160;&#160; The PETG 3D printing filament has a four week wait time from the manufacturers.&quot; said Professor Bordeau.<br></p><p><br></p></div>

<div><b>Article Content:</b> <p>​By now most of you have probably heard about various security vulnerabilities related to the Zoom virtual meeting/conferencing service. Although, many of the stories that have been reported in the press were accurate at the time, it does appear that Zoom has worked diligently to correct the more serious vulnerabilities.</p><p>One of the issues that continues to be a serious concern is the hi-jacking of Zoom meeting sessions, better known as &quot;Zoombombing&quot;. Zoom has released a blog post entitled &quot;How to Keep Uninvited Guests Out of Your Zoom Event&quot; [<a href="https&#58;//blog.zoom.us/wordpress/2020/03/20/keep-uninvited-guests-out-of-your-zoom-event/">Link</a>] that is worth reading to ensure that you and your participants have the best meeting/instruction experience possible.</p><p>The FBI has also provided the following tips for Zoom users …</p><ul style="list-style-type&#58;disc;"><li>Do not make meetings or classrooms public. In Zoom, there are two options to make a meeting private&#58; require a meeting password or use the waiting room feature and control the admittance of guests.</li><li>Do not share a link to a teleconference or classroom on an unrestricted publicly available social media post. Provide the link directly to specific people.</li><li>Manage screensharing options. In Zoom, change screensharing to &quot;Host Only.&quot;</li></ul><p>In addition to Zoom, there are a myriad of other virtual meeting solutions that you may wish to consider…</p><ul><li>Webex (free accounts available at 
      <a href="http&#58;//www.webex.com/">www.webex.com</a>) </li><li>Skype for Business (Available through the web on Office365 and installed on every KCC employee system)</li><li>Teams (Included in our Campus agreement, available through the web on Office365 and installed on every KCC staff system)</li><li>Google Meet (Web based service, available to all KCC users at 
      <a href="https&#58;//meet.google.com/">https&#58;//meet.google.com/</a>)<br></li>
   <li>Canvas Conferences (services provided by BigBlueButton and available to KCC faculty and students with 
      <a href="https&#58;//kcc.instructure.com/">https&#58;//kcc.instructure.com</a>)</li></ul><p>As always if you have any questions or concerns, or would like additional information regarding Zoom security, please do not hesitate to reach out to the ITS Help Desk at (815) 802-8900 or

Time will be entered in as a positive rather than a negative number (counting up/not counting down), like bereavement and jury duty is now.&#160; The new leave code is <strong>CVNW – Coronavirus Not Working</strong><strong>.</strong></p><p>5)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; If someone is <span style="text-decoration&#58;underline;">unavailable to work and is requesting a paid benefit day</span> (vacation, personal, give, floating holiday, sick) – if that person is truly off from work (not working remotely, not answering emails, phone calls, or instant messages, nor participating in webex meetings, etc.) then that person needs to submit the appropriate number of hours not working under the respective <strong>&quot;BENEFIT TIME USED&quot;</strong> column.</p><p>6)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Part time employees do not need to submit time sheets going forward (unless they are actually working remotely, or on campus like our police officers) since they will be receiving stipends equivalent to their actual hours worked for the pay period ending &#160;2/29/20.&#160;&#160;</p><p>If anyone has any questions, please contact David at ext. 8128.&#160;&#160;<br></p></div>

<div><b>Article Content:</b> <p>​As KCC transitions to a virtual campus for the next few weeks, the ITS team thought it might be helpful to share some best practices about working remotely.<br></p><ul><li>All of the communication&#160;tools that you use when on campus at KCC are available to you remotely including e-mail, instant messaging (Skype for Business) and your phone. Use the tool that is most appropriate based on the timeliness of the response that you&#160;require.</li><li>Pay attention to your habits and design your day around your peak productivity.</li><li>Adopt a routine most days of the week. Know when you start your work day and when you should end your work day.</li><li>Always use video in conference calls. People tune out when it's an audio-only call.</li><li>Turn your camera on and be present when you're meeting with people. Try to make time for rapport-building even when you're just meeting remotely.</li><li>Find moments to connect as human beings across the distance, like remembering to message &quot;good morning&quot; or &quot;have a nice evening&quot;. Little things create the sense of togetherness across huge leaps of time and space.</li><li>Stay in constant communication with your team and your manager about what you are working on.</li><li>Be sure to check in with your manager and if you're managing direct reports be sure to ask &quot;Are you getting what you need from me?&quot; This will foster a conversation around objectives and ensure both the employee and employer are getting what they need!</li><li>Remaining visible while working remotely is a crucial key to our overall success - whether it involves creating and following a calendar, scheduling weekly calls, or putting in extra effort to complete a project.</li><li>Making sure to follow up on assigned work is an important aspect when working remotely. Without following up, a project or task may be backlogged -- until you realize the deadline is tomorrow. Being consistent about notifying your coworkers and managers about your completed work allows your progress to be tracked and ensures goals will be met.<br></li></ul><div>Working remotely doesn't have to be a challenge. With proper planning and an understanding that tasks may take longer than when working face-to-face, you'll be able to accomplish whatever it is you set out to do.<br></div></div>

<div><b>Article Content:</b> <p>Like the rest of the college, the KCC Food Pantry would like to prepare for a possible college closure due to the coronavirus pandemic. Because many of our students rely on the Food Pantry to alleviate their food insecurity we want to develop a plan now so that we can provide students with sacks of food to take home. We are in desperate need of plastic grocery type bags or recyclable bags that we can pack food in. Any donations of non perishable foods (ramen, granola bars, snacks, canned meats/fish, Mac and cheese) would also help. And as always, I deeply appreciate your ongoing support of the KCC Food Pantry.&#160;<br></p><p><br></p></div>

      <title>Message to employees about coronavirus and actions</title>
      <link>https://my.kcc.edu/Lists/CampusNews/CustomDispForm.aspx?ID=679</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div><b>Article Category:</b> Update (Faculty and Staff Newsletter)</div>
<div><b>Article Thumbnail:</b> <img alt="" src="/PublishingImages/Update/Coronavirus.jpg" style="BORDER: 0px solid; "></div>
<div><b>Article Content:</b> <p><em>The following was emailed to all employees at approximately 4&#58;40 p.m. March 12.​</em></p><p>Colleagues,<br></p><p>Kankakee Community College will extend its spring break until March 22, and most face-to-face instruction will move online March 23. This action is to reduce potential pathways for community spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).</p><p>This is not a college closure.<br></p><p>There will be no classes in any format from March 16-22 to allow faculty and staff involved in instruction to make the adjustment to online delivery. Beginning on March 23 through April 20 faculty will teach lecture classes online. Each professor/instructor will communicate with their students regarding how their specific classes will proceed in an online environment. Some labs will continue to meet in person. Clinicals will continue as allowed by the host site.</p><p>KCC’s Riverfront Campus and its extension sites will remain open. Student support services like tutoring, advising, registration, food pantry, computer labs, and campus resources are still available. While on campus, please practice social distancing guidelines. The Centers for Disease Control defines social distancing as &quot;remaining out of congregate settings, avoiding mass gatherings&#160;and maintaining distance (approximately 6 feet) from others when possible.&quot;</p><p>KCC will update&#160;<a href="https&#58;//coronavirus.kcc.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable">coronavirus.kcc.edu</a>&#160;as the main source of information for our college’s actions and response.</p><p>The Office of Instructional Technology and Faculty Development offers&#160;<a href="https&#58;//guides.instructure.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable">Canvas</a>&#160;support for faculty and students who need it and you can direct questions to&#160;<a href="mailto&#58;canvashelp@kcc.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable">canvashelp@kcc.edu</a>. Information Technology Services and the ITS Help Desk provides&#160;<a href="http&#58;//www.kcc.edu/students/helpful/it/Pages/helpdesk.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable">support for online technologies</a>.<br></p><p>I realize this is a major disruption of academics. I’ve made these decisions with all the current information available from the&#160;<a href="http&#58;//www.dph.illinois.gov/topics-services/diseases-and-conditions/diseases-a-z-list/coronavirus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable">Illinois Department of Public Health</a>, the&#160;<a href="https&#58;//www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable">Centers for Disease Control</a>, and in consultation with other Illinois community college presidents, KCC’s administrative and faculty leadership teams. I feel it is the best way to minimize the risk of spreading the virus. It is my hope that temporarily moving to the online environment will minimize the spread of the virus, while still pursuing our educational mission.<br></p><p>Other immediate effects</p><ul><li>College-sponsored student travel is suspended, with limited exceptions for intercollegiate athletics. At these events, only the athletes and coaches may be present.</li><li>Events at KCC with 50 or more anticipated attendees are postponed at least through April 20. All gatherings should practice social distancing guidelines.</li><li>Non-essential college-sponsored travel for faculty, administrators, and staff is suspended. Please consult with the President’s Office for exceptions.</li><li>Third-party employers will make decisions related to their employees on our&#160;sites. This pertains to Student Success Center construction and the North Extension Center, which houses some Riverside personnel and other agencies.</li></ul><p>As we continue to monitor the situation we may need to take additional steps. On or before April 20, the college will consult with public health authorities&#160;regarding conditions, as well as resumption of face-to-face instruction. Looking forward, if significant events such as Commencement are going to be affected, we will communicate as far in advance as possible. As of today, we don’t have enough information to make those decisions.</p><p>I believe in the work ethic, dedication, and resiliency of the KCC community. We will get through this together. I would especially like to thank the faculty for the deep care they have shown in adjusting their teaching to accommodate our students' needs. As we work through this unprecedented situation, our propensity to be flexible and work together as a team has made the difference. You have put the college’s vision statement into action and you have my gratitude.</p><p>Sincerely,<br></p><p>Dr. Michael Boyd<br>KCC President<br></p></div>

<div><b>Article Content:</b> <p>​Looking for a way to impact current and future KCC students? Here's your chance! The KCC Foundation is seeking scholarship readers/ evaluators for the 2020-2021 Foundation Scholarship Application.&#160;Nearly four hundred students have completed the Foundation Scholarship Application for the chance at 206 unique awards ranging from $250-$5000 for the year. For some students, receiving these scholarships is the deciding factor in choosing to attend KCC.&#160;A scholarship reader/ evaluator will review the application and score the applicant, helping to determine if they receive a scholarship. We understand that your time is valuable, so if you volunteer to read, you evaluate as many applications as you would like.&#160; There is no maximum or minimum to complete. All reading and evaluating is done anonymously and online!&#160;Application review takes place from March 18-April 27.&#160;You can read from the privacy of your own home or anywhere else you choose.&#160;Your input is so important in selecting the 2020-2021 scholarship recipients. &#160;</p><p>If you have any questions or to volunteer, contact Jen Zimmerman in the Foundation Office at <a href="mailto&#58;jzimmerman@kcc.edu">jzimmerman@kcc.edu</a> or x8251. If you are already a scholarship reader/ evaluator, we thank you for your continued participation.&#160;You can expect an email with instructions to log in on March 18. Instructions will be provided to all volunteers. &#160;<br></p></div>

<div><b>Article Content:</b> <p><img src="/PublishingImages/telephone%20etiquestte.jpg" class="ms-rtePosition-1" alt="" style="margin&#58;5px;" />Proper telephone etiquette can leave either a positive or negative phone experience for callers and potential customers.&#160; Sometimes you may have to transfer a caller to another person or department, and unfortunately, this often irritates the caller.&#160; To ensure a positive experience, apply these strategies&#58;</p><p>&#160;</p><ol style="list-style-type&#58;decimal;"><li><strong>State what you can do, not what you cannot do</strong>.&#160; You might say, &quot;I can help by letting you talk to Jerry in Finance.&quot;&#160; &quot;Should we be disconnected, his extension is 267.&quot;&#160; &quot;May I connect you now?&quot;</li></ol><p>&#160;</p><ol start="2" style="list-style-type&#58;decimal;"><li><strong>Avoid using the word transfer</strong>.&#160; The term transfer can often be irritating to a caller, especially if they have talked to several people.&#160; &quot;Let me connect you to …&quot; or &quot;I'll let you talk with …&quot; provide a positive experience.&#160; Be sure to give them your coworker's extension number.</li></ol><p>&#160;</p><ol start="3" style="list-style-type&#58;decimal;"><li><strong>When connecting a call to another department or coworker, share with them the customer's name and any facts you obtained</strong>.&#160; The customer will feel they are making progress because they do not have to repeat the information again.&#160; The key is to have just enough facts for your coworker to be prepared to talk with the caller.&#160; You might say, &quot;Debbie, Jerry would like to send a transcript.&#160; When I hang up, he will be on the line.&quot;</li></ol><p>&#160;</p><ol start="4" style="list-style-type&#58;decimal;"><li><strong>Ask the customer if you can connect their call</strong>.&#160; The customer may tell you they have already spoken to multiple people and do not want to talk with anyone else.&#160; Learn as much as you can about the situation, gather the information they seek, and call the customer back.</li></ol><p>Then again, they may no longer have time available to talk, but because they have the name and number of the person they need to speak with, they can call them directly when time is available. </p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>Adapted for Kankakee Community College from, <em>The World of Customer Service</em>, 2012.<br></p><p><br></p></div>

<div><b>Article Content:</b> <div>Congratuations to Todd Post on&#160;receiving the Daily Journal's award for Male Sports Citizen of the Year! The following <a href="https&#58;//www.daily-journal.com/sports/male-sports-citizen-of-the-year-kcc-s-post-a/article_a3ed2c4c-4236-11ea-b963-ef08dc2e5c53.html">news&#160;article</a> is&#160;reprinted from The Daily Journal.<br></div><div><br><div><strong>Male Sports Citizen of the Year&#58; KCC's Post a baseball lifer</strong></div><div>Mason Schweizer | mschweizer@daily-journal.com | 815-937-3300</div><div>Jan 29, 2020<br></div><div><br></div>When Todd Post began his college basketball career at Danville Community College in 1984, he did so with baseball still as his primary love.<br></div><div>“Baseball was always my first love, but I had an opportunity to play basketball,” Post said of the decision he made after graduating from Crescent-Iroquois High School. “I chose that opportunity and stay close to basketball as a fan.”<br></div><div>After graduating from Danville in 1987, Post returned to his love of baseball when he hit the diamond for a year at Kankakee Community College in 1988 and then two more years at Benedictine University.<br></div><div>Ever since then, baseball has been what Post is most known for. He’s been a coach at KCC since 1993, taking the reins as head coach in 2001. Since he took over, Post has piled up 791 wins, 16 sectional and two regional championships and made a pair of National Junior College Athletic Association Division II World Series appearances, winning it all in 2017.<br></div><div>Because of his excellence as a coach, Post was inducted into the NJCAA Region IV Hall of Fame. That excellence, as well as a career dedicated to various roles at KCC he also has held since becoming a coach, serving as an academic advisor before being named athletic director in 2016, have helped make Post this year’s Daily Journal Male Sports Citizen of the Year.<br></div><div>For Post, it’s the ability to do what he’s dreamed of doing since his high school days as a Golden Eagle that has allowed his success. He spent a few brief years teaching at his alma mater before his move to KCC.<br></div><div>“Since my senior year of high school, I had a vision of [teaching and coaching] as an opportunity, and I can’t say it could have worked out any better,” Post said. “When I got the opportunity to come here as an assistant coach and full-time employee, I wasn’t sure how long I would be an assistant and hoped to be the head coach some day.<br></div><div>“That day happened in 2001 ... and since then, the success we’ve had has been from great assistant coaches, and the college and athletic department have given the program the avenues we’ve needed for that success.”<br></div><div>One of those assistant coaches, current assistant Bryce Shafer, said it’s the attention to detail Post pays to the small things that have added up to this sustained success on a larger scale.<br></div><div>“He’s doing everything right all the time,” Shafer said. “If you’ve ever walked around campus or walked around the field with Coach Post, you know he stops 50 times to pick up a piece of trash.<br></div><div>“He wants everything to run right; he wants the field to look nice, and he wants you to do the right thing,” he added of his current mentor. “He wants you to do what you think is the right thing all the time.”<br></div><div>Post said that attention to detail and urging of doing the right thing are just a few ingredients he has been able to positively implement during his time in Kankakee.<br></div><div>“Recruiting is a big part of that, doing things right and developing these players,” Post said. “Developing socially and athletically, but you also have to put your time in in the classroom and get that degree to give yourself an opportunity to move on at various levels academically.”<br></div><div>During Post’s tenure, 12 players have been drafted by a major league organization or played independent professional baseball and two players he coached, Bryce Redeker and Casey Fletcher, are a couple of the 11 total NJCAA Region IV Hall-of-Famers from KCC.<br></div><div>Seeing his own name added to the previous list of 10 hall-of-famers from the school, a list that features names such as former Major League Baseball player Tom Prince and basketball coaches such as Denny Lehnus and Donnie Denson, a pair of coaches Post said he has modeled himself after, has helped to give him a sense of the effect he has had on others.<br></div><div>“To be voted in, I think that it kind of gives you a feeling that you’ve made an impact on some people,” Post said. “And I appreciate being thought of as a hall-of-fame coach.”<br></div><div>The son of a teacher, Phyllis, Post was influenced by both his mother and father Robert to go down the career path he has navigated successfully. Perhaps the most beautiful part of that path came the past two seasons, when Post was able to coach his son, Dylan, at KCC.<br></div><div>Dylan was able to play baseball for his dad in various youth leagues along the way, culminating at the junior college level. Now a student at Illinois State University, Dylan said his dad has a tough coaching style, something that pairs well with the person he is.<br></div><div>“He’s got good morals; he knows a lot about the game, and he educates a lot of young people,” Dylan said of his dad. “When they play for him, they don’t always see eye to eye because he’s hard on them, but when they move on, they realize he made them a better player and better person in all aspects of life.<br></div><div>”He just wants everyone to succeed.”<br></div><div>Dylan’s athletic career saw plenty of success, as he was on Bishop McNamara’s 2015 football state championship team and the 2017 boys basketball third-place team.<br></div><div>Todd was able to be at both of those games, but there were times, especially during Dylan’s high school basketball and baseball days, when he wasn’t able to watch his son.<br></div><div>A supportive family, including wife Julianne and daughter Jordan, was able to be there while Todd was with the Cavaliers, which Post said is a representation of how vital his family has been to his success.<br></div><div>&quot;You give and you take, but my wife has been very supportive,” Todd said. “She’s never missed a game.”<br></div><div>Just as the Post name has become part of everyday life at KCC, the Cavaliers also have become a part of the Post family. For Dylan, a memory of his dad after the Cavaliers’ 2017 World Series title perfectly symbolizes that.<br></div><div>”He actually slept in his uniform the night they won it, the trophy in his lap,” Dylan said. “It meant a lot to him to win it, and it meant a lot to me seeing him so happy and his hard work pay off.”<br></div></div>

She did a fantastic job integrating &quot;Cars&quot; the movie with words and symbols related to the journey a KCC student takes (certificate, degree, Lifelong Learning, etc.).</p><p>&quot;I would like to thank Diane Soltis from marketing for her collaboration and work on the ornaments, Ellen Schmidt for her support in accomplishing my vision and John Bordeau for showing me how to use his laser engraver,&quot; Alison said.&#160;&quot;Participants must be not-for-profit, so I would also like to thank the KCC Foundation and staff for allowing us to represent KCC via the Foundation.&quot;</p><p>Over 2,000 area students as well as numerous community members visit the Gallery of Trees in&#160;December.&#160;The public can vote for a favorite tree, voting is separated into adult favorite and children's favorite.&#160;If you get a chance, visit the tree display any time from Dec. 1-30 -- and vote!&#160;<br></p><p>Having the tree on display fits well with&#160;the college goal&#160;to be more visible in the community.&#160;Alison and other members of the&#160;Strategic Enrollment Management Recruitment subcommittee are among those assisting&#160;in this&#160;effort.&#160;<br></p><p>The museum is at 801 S 8th Ave, Kankakee. More details and museum hours are on the&#160;<a href="http&#58;//www.kankakeecountymuseum.com/event---gallery-of-trees.html">Gallery of Trees</a>&#160;page. Suggested donation for visitors to the Gallery of Trees is $2.</p><p>There's also an <a href="https&#58;//news.kcc.edu/2019/11/22/festive-tree-display-features-kcc.html">article in the KCC newsroom</a> with a few more details.<br></p></div>

<div><b>Article Content:</b> <p>​</p><p>From the KCC police department,</p><p>Due to a combination of many circumstances, unfortunately we are not going to be able to organize and hold our traditional shop with a cop event at the campus this year. As many of you know and for those who don't the police department has sponsored an event for a number of years where we raise money for gifts for KCC student's children in need.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;It took a tremendous effort from our college community with help from the nursing department, the Safety Committee members, the KCC police department, and others from all across the college to shop for and wrap the gifts, host the dinner with pizza, drinks and cookies, a fantastic volunteer Santa and Mrs. Claus, decorating the college center and all the crafts, storytelling, and pictures on Santa's lap. </p><p>&#160;</p><p>It is with great sadness that that event will not be able to happen this year. But as an alternative the police department is still going to sponsor &quot;Shop with a Cop&quot;. We have decided to raise money for gifts for children in need in our area. We will purchase a variety of toys, &#160;wrap the gifts, and then deliver them to KCC students with children, and any extra gifts purchased will go to the children in various shelters in Kankakee that help&#160; to serve our community. </p><p>&#160;</p><p>If you wish to contribute please give your kind donations to Eric Springer or Travis miller by the end of the day on Wednesday November 27<sup>th</sup>. Also by Wednesday the 27<sup>th</sup> please share with Eric or Travis the names and contact information of KCC students with children in need. All the money donated will go to help the children. Once the gifts are ready we will be reaching out to those families to make sure the children share in the joy of the holiday season! Thanks in advance for helping bring happiness and hope to those children in need! </p></div>

<div><b>Article Content:</b> <p>​Today is KCC's 12th annual Halloween Contest between departments. Take a walk around campus&#160;and&#160;check&#160;out&#160;all&#160;the&#160;participants.&#160;&#160;Then stop by the Security Desk in front of the library and place your vote for your favorite theme&#160;and your favorite individual costume.</p><p>If you are part of a theme, you cannot vote for favorite theme, but definitely vote for your favorite&#160;individual&#160;costume.&#160;Your&#160;favorite&#160;individual does not have to be part of a theme.</p><p>We are giving a prize for student choice as well so make sure you use the orange ballots for all&#160;staff voting. Since student workers are staff and can go to all areas, they can vote as staff. Students cannot go to all areas so that is why there is a separate ballot. We want to be fair to all areas.<br></p><p>The following departments are participating&#58; Adult Education, Advising, Business Affairs/HR/Accounting, Career Services &amp; Continuing Education, Financial Aid, L355 Academic Office, Student Support Services/Upward Bound/TRIO Talent Search, and W102 Academic Office.<br></p></div>

This will be the twelfth year that areas of the college have competed against each other for the best Halloween costumes and department theme. I hope to see everyone from last year (and maybe more) join in on the fun again this year.<br></p><p><img src="/PublishingImages/2018-l355-academic-office-250.jpg" class="ms-rtePosition-2" alt="" style="margin&#58;5px;" />The competition was very close last year. L355&#160;has been participating for all of the past 11 years (since we started this whole thing we have to keep competing) and we were very excited to win—barely! I can't wait to see what caldron of fun everyone has come up with this year!&#160;<br></p><p>Each area's theme should be kept under wraps to make the day more exciting. As an incentive, the winning department will keep the &quot;Fabulous&quot; Traveling Tacky Trophy and will be able to show it off until the 2020 competition. <br></p><p>There will also be a Traveling Tacky Trophy for best costume which can be kept on display until next year. The winner of the best costume does not have to be part of one of the office/area themes. We have had a tie for the last two years for best individual costume and one individual each year was not part of a theme.<br></p><p><span class="ms-rteForeColor-3" style="font-size&#58;16px;"><strong>Those who are part of a department theme </strong><strong>cannot</strong><strong> vote for best theme, but </strong><strong>should</strong><strong> definitely vote for best individual costume.</strong></span></p><p>If your department or staff in your area would like to get into the spirit of the day, please contact me, <a href="mailto&#58;spfaff@kcc.edu">spfaff@kcc.edu</a> or 815-802-8700 by Friday, Oct. 25.<br></p><p>Sheila&#160;Pfaff, L355 Academic Office<br></p></div>

encouraging her PTA students to work our table. They were wonderful to work
with. Our very own Cavalier worked the crowd. It was a great evening. <br>

<div><b>Article Content:</b> <div>The entirety of the Humanities and Social Sciences Division encourages you to join us in celebrating transfer institutions during Transfer Week, September 23-27.<br></div><div>HSS folks (faculty, staff, and administrators) will represent their alma maters on Wednesday, September 25, the day of the Transfer Fair, by wearing their college gear (t-shirts, sweatshirts, etc). In addition, they'll be hanging pennants from their alma maters on their doors or in prominent places in their offices beginning on Monday that week. Some folks intend to wear a different college t-shirt (regardless of whether they attended that school) each day that week so students have exposure to an even larger variety of transfer institution options.<br></div><div>We hope you will all join us in the fun and likewise take time to talk with interested students about your alma maters and answer any questions students may have about those schools.<br></div><div>Thanks!<br></div><p><br></p></div>

<div><b>Article Content:</b> <p><img src="/PublishingImages/Update/Freezer_less_than_250.jpg" alt="" style="margin&#58;5px;" /></p><p>I&#160;would like to share with you all some exciting news about the KCC Food Pantry!&#160; Thanks to a generous staff donor, we have added a chest freezer and are providing students with ready-to-eat frozen lunches.&#160; Additionally, one of our faculty members has pledged to donate a refrigerator. This semester the Food Pantry has been averaging 100 visits a week by students.&#160; We have expanded hours into the evening and are now open 46 hours a week this semester.&#160; Finally, I was invited to speak with Whitney Thompson next week at the Forum for Excellence meeting, Illinois' premier CTE and AE professional development event.&#160; Below is a synopsis of our talk.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>Whitney Thompson, Illinois Community College Board</p><p>Francesca Catalano, Kankakee Community College</p><p>Food insecurity among college students is growing at an alarming rate. Research has indicated as high as 56% of college students, particularly those enrolled in community colleges, are facing food scarcity on a daily basis. In early 2019, the ICCB conducted a survey on how community colleges were addressing food insecurity on their campus. This breakout will also feature the grassroots efforts that transpired at Kankakee Community College to address food insecurity. Participants will learn about research on this topic, results of the survey conducted by the ICCB, as well as resources colleges and students can tap into.<br></p><p><br></p></div>

The event will include delegates from other academic institutions. KCC's ceremonial mace and&#160;a&#160;chains-of-office medallion, like the one pictured in this&#160;article, will be a part of the ceremony.&#160;<br></div><div>Colleges often host a week of activities during inauguration week.

Dr. Boyd said…</div><div><ul><li><strong>Van Fab, Inc</strong>. in Union Hill suffered a fire recently.&#160; KCC, in collaboration with the Workforce Board and the Economic Alliance, has reached out to Van Fab to offer assistance.&#160; KCC’s workforce services will be able to place many workers who may be displaced.&#160; We have also offered a Job Fair to work on placing these people back into positions.&#160;</li><li><strong>NIMS Training</strong> – KCC’s leadership team reviewed our plan and command structure today. We’ll have more to offer later in the year, but please know that we have plans in place.&#160;</li><li><strong>Estate Plans</strong> - The college received a bequest from Janet V.

      <title>New campus master plan guides future projects</title>

<div><b>Article Content:</b> <p>The <a href="http&#58;//www.kcc.edu/Community/Documents/KCC_Master%20Plan_Final_-compressed.pdf">Campus Facilities Master Plan</a> was approved by the Board of Trustees at their July meeting. The purpose of the plan is to address existing concerns, provide for current needs, and accommodate future needs at the Riverfront campus.&#160;<br></p><p>The process to develop the plan began in late 2018 with an inventory and assessment of existing facilities. Input was then gathered from a broad spectrum of faculty, staff, and students through 13&#160;focus groups that were conducted with the architectural firm. Given existing conditions and with the input of the institution’s constituents, several iterations of plans were considered to address current and future needs. The culmination of the process resulted in the <a href="http&#58;//www.kcc.edu/Community/Documents/KCC_Master%20Plan_Final_-compressed.pdf">Campus Master Plan</a>.<br></p><p>The plan will serve as a guide for potential future facilities projects. Whether or when particular projects are actually executed will be dependent on institutional priorities, available resources, and Board approval to proceed.<br></p></div>

      <title>LGBT+ History Month</title>

<div><b>Article Content:</b> <p><img src="/PublishingImages/Update/GSA_less_than250.jpg" alt="" style="margin&#58;5px;" /><br></p><p>June 28 marks the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall uprising in New York City, the catalyst for the modern day LGBT+ civil rights movement. The events at <a href="https&#58;//www.britannica.com/event/Stonewall-riots">Stonewall Inn</a>, now a National Historical Landmark, galvanized tributes a month later that over the years have been transformed into Pride celebrations every June.&#160;</p><p>June has also been&#160;meaningful for the LGBT+ community in other ways&#58; June 26th represents the sixth year anniversary of the landmark case for marriage equality, <a href="https&#58;//www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-307_6j37.pdf">United States v Windsor</a>. The Supreme Court of the United States held in that seminal civil rights case that the Defense of Marriage Act was unconstitutional as a &quot;deprivation of the equal liberty of persons as protected by the Fifth Amendment&quot;. In June 2020 the Supreme Court will hand down decisions on <a href="https&#58;//www.google.com/amp/s/www.pbs.org/newshour/amp/politics/supreme-court-to-hear-lgbt-job-discrimination-cases">three cases</a> that will determine whether Title VII, the part of the Civil Rights Act prohibiting discrimination in the workplace, specifically protects LGBT+ employees. A decision in favor will ensure federal protections nationwide. </p><p>No civil rights movement can survive without the support and encouragement of allies. A large part of being an effective LGBT+ ally is participating in those difficult conversations and establishing a reputation for not tolerating offensive behaviors. Please click <a href="https&#58;//www.hrc.org/blog/how-to-be-an-lgbt-ally">here</a> for more information on how you can be an&#160;LGBT+ ally.&#160;<br></p></div>

      <title>Outmigration and Community Colleges</title>
      <link>https://my.kcc.edu/Lists/CampusNews/CustomDispForm.aspx?ID=498</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div><b>Article Description:</b> Dr. Boyd&#39;s opinion piece about reversing Illinois&#39; population drop was published in the Daily Journal Weekend Edition on June 8. </div>
<div><b>Article Category:</b> Update (Faculty and Staff Newsletter)</div>
<div><b>Article Thumbnail:</b> <img alt="" src="/PublishingImages/Update/KCCPowerOfCommunity.jpg" style="BORDER: 0px solid; "></div>
<div><b>Article Content:</b> <p>In late 2018, the U.S. Census Bureau reported that 86 of Illinois' 102 counties experienced population decline. Closer to home, on June 1, 2019, <a href="https&#58;//www.daily-journal.com/news/local/county-drops-in-population/article_d9b1f1c0-82e5-11e9-9364-cfceb5f2e25d.html?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=email&amp;utm_campaign=user-share">The Daily Journal reported</a> that most of the region's major municipalities experienced decline, including a 3% population drop in Kankakee County since the 2010 census. We should have concerns about negative population trends beyond the potential loss of home-rule status. Population decline in Illinois corresponds to the rising cost of college. Sources including an independent organization called Illinois Policy state that the cost of college in Illinois increased as much as 100% between 2006 and 2016.<span style="text-decoration&#58;line-through;"> </span>Illinois students and their parents face a difficult decision when they realize that out-of-state schools are more affordable than the public universities supported by their own tax dollars. Al Bowman, then executive director of the Illinois Board of Higher Education, was correct when he observed, &quot;Illinois has become fertile ground for institutions around the Midwest to recruit&quot; (<em>Chicago Sun Times</em>; Sept. 21, 2018 &quot;<a href="https&#58;//chicago.suntimes.com/2018/9/21/18479757/why-chicago-area-high-school-students-are-leaving-illinois-for-college">Why Chicago-area high school students are leaving Illinois for college</a>,&quot; Adam Thorp and Jane Recker).</p><p>An answer to this problem—and a way to reverse the trend of outmigration and shrinking populations—lies in the community college, a resource available in every community in Illinois. Specifically, dual credit programs establish close partnerships between local high schools and the community college. Dual credit means the high school student enrolls in a course—usually at their high school—and earns college credit, and it also counts toward high school graduation.</p><p>On June 5, 2019, a group of educators representing Illinois' high schools, community colleges and state agencies sent the Illinois Community College Board and the Illinois State Board of Education a proposal called &quot;Model Partnership Agreement.&quot; It creates better guidance and structure for agreements between local school districts and community colleges to deliver dual credit. Prompted by recent legislative amendments to Illinois' Dual Credit Quality Act, the agreement has potential to change the way Illinois schools offer dual credit. Therefore, it can greatly increase access to high quality, rigorous college classes offered at reasonable costs.</p><p>The agreement includes provisions which, if implemented locally, will create opportunities for high school students to enroll in core college courses taught at their home high schools for a rate equal to 8% of the local community college's cost. At Kankakee Community College's current cost of $161 per credit for tuition and fees, the maximum cost to a dual credit student for a three-credit course would be $38.64. </p><p>That's right! A Kankakee and Iroquois-area high school student could enroll in a college-credit course for under $40. Where it is appropriate, the Model Partnership Agreement also encourages school districts to reduce the rate to students even further, making classes free or very low cost.&#160; </p><p>Many community college students wish to transfer to public universities. Many of these dual credit courses which are a part of the general education core will transfer because they are part of the Illinois Articulation Initiative, a transfer agreement which includes all Illinois public colleges and universities (learn more at itransfer.org).</p><p>Every Illinois community college already has local agreements with school districts to offer dual credit classes. Successful implementation of the &quot;Model Partnership Agreement&quot; will expand access to every student who is ready for college-level work. But, successful implementation means supporting and encouraging students to enroll.</p><p>If we commit to reversing the outmigration trend in Illinois, and if we are not content to sit idly by and watch the populations in our villages, towns and cities dwindle away, it is vital that we take pride in our community colleges. It is time for us to leverage strong partnerships which can exist between school districts and community colleges. As parents, we can have frank conversations with our high school aged children about their college and career plans. We can speak openly with them about the very real burdens of college loan debt. As educators, we must be open and flexible in how we deliver instruction to meet the needs of the students whose success we enable. We must focus on the community college as a necessary first two years before entering the workforce or transferring to a university. As citizens, we need to champion our local community college so our students enroll with a sense of pride in their community and all the wonderful things it has to offer.<br></p></div>

      <title>Porter and Henneike named as 2019 Outstanding Faculty Award recipients</title>
      <link>https://my.kcc.edu/Lists/CampusNews/CustomDispForm.aspx?ID=455</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div><b>Article Description:</b> Announcement of 2019 Outstanding Faculty Awards</div>
<div><b>Article Category:</b> Update (Faculty and Staff Newsletter)</div>
<div><b>Article Thumbnail:</b> <img alt="" src="/staff/PublishingImages/Pages/default/Outstanding%20Faculty.png" style="BORDER: 0px solid; "></div>
<div><b>Article Content:</b> <p>​The Outstanding Full-Time Faculty Member recipient is <strong>Amy Porter</strong>, English professor in the Humanities and Social Sciences Division.</p><img src="file&#58;///C&#58;/Users/ckeigher/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image002.jpg" alt="" style="width&#58;16px;margin&#58;5px;" /><p><img src="/facultyIS/PublishingImages/APorter-DSC_8253.JPG" class="ms-rtePosition-1" alt="" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;200px;" />Amy Porter began her journey in teaching as a graduate assistant at Illinois State University after completing a B.S. in psychology. Although it was not her original plan, she took on the challenge of teaching English with no formal education on how to do so. She was surprised to find that teaching was the career that she had hoped for—uniting her expertise in psychology with leading a classroom. Over the years, she has taught rhetoric/composition at Joliet Junior College; Prairie State College; and Governors State University, where she also co-managed a writing center. In 2008, she began as an adjunct professor at Kankakee Community College, and was hired full-time in 2011. Porter has stayed current in her field by attending and presenting at a variety of conferences around the country, most recently at the 2018 Two-Year College English Association conference in Indianapolis for a panel discussion of how adverse childhood experiences affect the way college students learn. She looks forward to pursuing this research even further and continues to see great benefits in the classroom from the implementation of her findings.<br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><div><br></div>The Outstanding Part-Time Faculty Member recipient is <strong>Claire Henneike</strong>, who teaches college-level dual credit English in the Humanities and Social Sciences Division.<div><br><p><img src="/facultyIS/PublishingImages/Claire%20Henneike.jpg" class="ms-rtePosition-1" alt="" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;200px;height&#58;300px;" />Claire Henneike makes every effort to ensure that students in her dual-credit English classes feel supported in their transition into college. She considers herself a lifelong learner, which speaks to her love for teaching. In her years teaching at both Watseka High School and KCC, she has displayed a real commitment to the success of her students. Henneike has been instrumental in closing the gap between high school and college readiness for local high school students. With her assistance, KCC has made strides in better preparing students for transfer-level coursework. She has also encouraged civic responsibility in her students by having them complete a project aimed at bettering their local community. Claire's energies demonstrate concern for her students that extends well beyond the confines of her classroom. </p><p><em>Porter and Henneike will be KCC's nominees for the annual Illinois Community College Trustees Association outstanding faculty awards presented in June.</em><br></p><p><br></p></div></div>

<div><b>Article Content:</b> <p>The Culture of Caring committee is inviting you to celebrate&#160;the core value of <strong>Learning</strong> during the month of March! As such, we would like to remind you to attend one of two &quot;Days of Learning&quot; sessions offered each day on March 4 and 5 (see <span class="ms-rteForeColor-2">Additional Info on Days of Learning</span> post to learn&#160;all of the specifics).</p><p><img src="/PublishingImages/Update/core-values-250.jpg" class="ms-rtePosition-2" alt="" style="margin&#58;5px;" />Here is a quick quote on Learning that Dr. Vicki Gardner uses at the bottom of her emails that we found enlightening&#58;&#160; <em>There is no end to education. It is not that you read a book, pass an examination, and finish with education. The whole of life, from the moment you are born to the moment you die, </em><em><strong>is a process of learning</strong></em><em> - Jiddu Krishnamurti</em></p><p>We have attached a six minute video on the six simple tips on the importance of Continuous Leaning, narrated by Jack Canfield.&#160; He is an American author, motivational speaker, corporate trainer, and entrepreneur. He also co-authored the Chicken Soup for the Soul series, which has more than 250 titles and 500 million copies in print in over 40 languages. </p><p>His six tips are&#58;</p><ol><li>Decrease your TV time (yes, he goes there)</li><li>Study other successful people</li><li>Learn how to read faster</li><li>Attend as many conferences workshops, and other in-person events as you can</li><li>Make a conscious commitment to yourself to engage in lifelong learning</li><li>Be prepared</li></ol><p>Here is the link to watch the video - <a href="https&#58;//www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7qaCZexob8"><span style="text-decoration&#58;underline;">https&#58;//www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7qaCZexob8</span></a></p><p>Additionally, our KCC Cavaliers Care Book provides the following definition of Leaning for KCC employees&#58;</p><p><em>Learning is the process by which we develop intellectually and emotionally. It is the acquisition of knowledge, skills, at­titudes, and behaviors that lead to personal and profession­al growth. As an institution of higher education, learning is at the heart of everything that we are and do at KCC. Indeed, our central mission is &quot;Enhancing quality of life through learning.&quot; This charge applies not only to the students, stakeholders, and residents we serve, but to each of us as employees. This dedication to learning is exemplified through our institutional commitment to innovation, con­tinuous quality improvement, research, and data informed decision-making. But it is also demonstrated through an openness to feedback and new ideas, a spirit of humility (particularly the recognition that there can be many different ways to address any issue), curiosity, and maintaining a healthy sense of humor and perspective. </em></p><p><strong>We can demonstrate learning with the following actions and beliefs&#58;</strong></p><ul><li>Pursue growth and learning for personal, professional, and institutional improvement. </li><li>Be open to new ideas, procedures, methods, and feed-back. </li><li>Recognize that empathy and compassion are the foundation of emotional intelligence. </li><li>Cultivate and use emotional intelligence when working with others. </li><li>Challenge myself to think outside the box and support the creative efforts of others. </li><li>Research and explore evidence-based best practices for the purpose of continuous quality improvement. </li><li>Embrace, encourage, and drive innovative change. </li><li>Provide mentorship, support, and cross-training to my colleagues as they seek to acquire new knowledge and skills.</li></ul></div>

<div><b>Article Content:</b> <div>A new Hospitality Operations certificate will be an option for KCC students beginning Fall 2019.&#160;</div><div>The 18-credit hour certificate packages two existing KCC courses along with four newly developed courses. It prepares students to enter the hospitality profession in hotels, restaurants, banquet and entertainment venues or meeting, convention and event planning settings. Employment opportunities are in restaurants, chambers of commerce, tourism destinations, recreation businesses and hotels.&#160;</div><div>“Entrepreneurship is the first class in the series because we see this program attracting entrepreneurs who are looking for the knowledge, skills and connections they need to develop an idea into a reality,” said Boyd. “We want this program to attract dreamers and innovators who have disruptive ideas that can transform the attractions of the area.”</div><div>Courses will be taught at KCC, with internship experiences at area facilities.&#160;</div><div>“Local businesses are interested in our hospitality students as interns and future employees.” said Dr. Michael Boyd, vice president for Instruction and Student Success. “We held a discussion with industry leaders in collaboration with Kankakee County Convention and Visitors Bureau and we had an overwhelming response.”</div><div>“We are proud to be a voice representing the tourism and hospitality industry and grateful that Kankakee Community College recognizes the need for a formal Hospitality Management academic program,” said Staci Wilken, executive director of the Kankakee County Convention and Visitors Bureau. “We hope this program can prepare students to roll out the red carpet for our guests.”&#160;</div><div>Students will be encouraged to earn Illinois Restaurant Association credentials in food handling, sanitation, alcohol and allergens. The hospitality classes also can be taken toward an associate degree, which can transfer to a hospitality program at a four-year college or university in Illinois to earn a bachelor’s degree.&#160;<br></div></div>

<div><b>Article Content:</b> <p>​From the current TV hit The Passage to time tested favorites like The Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones (back April 14<sup>th</sup>!!) science fiction/fantasy books have not only inspired scientists, engineers and mathematicians, they have also inspired science itself. &#160;Emboldened by our common affection for the genre as well as a desire to share some of our favorite books with our students, the faculty and staff of MSE have created the &quot;Little Sci/Fi/Fant Lending Library&quot; in a nook of the third floor R building, near the Food Pantry.&#160; The library is founded on a generous donation from Angry Robot Publishing (100 books on route!) and contains many of our favorites and other classic gems.&#160; Please stop by and take one or leave one – new and used donations of science fiction/fantasy are greatly appreciated.<br></p></div>

<div><b>Article Content:</b> <p>When SURS calculates a retirement benefit, all eligible calculation types are performed and the annuity is based on the calculation that provides the highest benefit. For most defined-benefit members (not SMP), this is a comparison between the General Formula and the Money Purchase calculation. <span class="ms-rteThemeForeColor-2-0" id="ms-rterangepaste-start" aria-hidden="true"></span><span class="ms-rteThemeForeColor-2-0" aria-hidden="true"></span><span class="ms-rteThemeForeColor-2-0" aria-hidden="true"></span><span class="ms-rteThemeForeColor-2-0">The Money Purchase factors used to determine monthly annuity benefits will change July 2, 2019</span><span class="ms-rteThemeForeColor-2-0">, </span>based upon the most recent experience study conducted by SURS actuaries. The new factors will result in a lower monthly benefit payment for those retiring on or after the July 2, 2019, effective date, <span class="ms-rteThemeForeColor-2-0">if their benefit is calculated to be highest using the Money Purchase calculation. It is estimated that the monthly benefit paid from the Money Purchase will be reduced on average by 5 percent to 6 percent, if retirement is deferred until after the new factors take effect. SURS estimates that active participants can recover this monthly reduction by delaying retirement for approximately six to seven months, due to the additional contributions and interest that would be added.</span><span aria-hidden="true"></span><span aria-hidden="true"></span></p><p>To learn more about these changes and how this might impact&#160;your decision to retire, please click on the following link&#58; <a href="/employees/hr/Documents/MoneyPurchaseFactors.pdf">https&#58;//my.kcc.edu/employees/hr/Documents/MoneyPurchaseFactors.pdf</a></p></div>

<div><b>Article Content:</b> <p><em>The following event is not sponsored by KCC. This information is being posted as a service to the community.</em><br></p><p>​GSU asked if we could spread the word about their upcoming performance of Alice in Wonderland on Nov. 1st and 2nd (Nov. 3rd already sold out).&#160; This is an experimental version which is rooted in the lens of Alice and many other characters as sexual assault survivors.&#160; Although the&#160;script will remain in its original writing, the director uses soft insinuations through vocal inflections, staging, and set design to tell this unique interpretation.<br></p><p>To support their cause and social project, CASA of Will County and Guardian Angels of Will County will be on site to provide materials and support. Student tickets can be purchased at $10 each up to two tickets per student with a valid student I.D.<br></p><p>For more detailed information regarding the performances, go to&#160;<a href="http&#58;//www.centertickets.net/">www.centertickets.net</a>&#160;and click on the Alice in Wonderland picture.</p><p>MATURE CONTENT/ON STAGE SEATING<br></p></div>

<div><b>Article Content:</b> <div><p><strong>Great Expectations is two weeks away.&#160;</strong><br>It’s a morning dedicated to strategic planning, and the college community is invited to share their creative ideas about the college’s future direction.

The Strategic Planning Oversight Committee (SPOC) hosted the forum, and afterward used the ideas to determine the future priorities. The photos in the article depict some of the SPOC team's work. Then, President’s Cabinet reviewed and refined them. Finally, the priorities were shared with faculty and staff, and action teams were organized for each priority. The action teams’ work ended earlier this year, and now we’re using the priorities to build the next strategic plan.<br></p><p><img src="/PublishingImages/Update/Affinity-mapping3.jpg" alt="" style="margin&#58;5px;" /><br></p><div><b><br></b></div><p><strong>How should I prepare?</strong><br>Take a look at the <a href="http&#58;//issuu.com/kankakeecommunitycollege/docs/kcc-data-book-2018?e=1915809/64458776">data book</a>, but there is no other preparation needed.

<div><b>Article Content:</b> <p>Want to increase your strength and flexibility while decreasing the stress in your life?&#160; How about joining a yoga class?&#160; </p><p>Lamanda Garcia, Assistant Professor of MLT/Phlebotomy Coordinator, has graciously volunteered to lead a class that will meet on Mondays and Wednesdays, from 11-11&#58;50 am in room G107.&#160; Whether you are a beginner or advanced, all levels are welcome.&#160; All you need is comfortable clothing, a yoga mat, and a block.&#160; Why a block?&#160; Most beginners are actually doing poses incorrectly.&#160; The block will help with proper alignment and can be used until greater flexibility and stability is realized.&#160; The classes are non-credit and are free to our employees.&#160; The first class will begin this Monday, August 27.&#160; Locker rooms are available directly across the hall – just bring a lock to secure your personal belongings.&#160; If interested, please discuss this first with your supervisor to ensure adequate staffing in your work areas and to adjust your hours to still work a 40-hr week.&#160; </p></div>

<div><b>Article Content:</b> <p>​Ethical Reasoning is next up in the general education outcome assessment rotation! Faculty members teaching courses with this outcome will be contacted at the beginning of the fall semester. Later in the term those faculty members will receive a randomized list of a sample of their students; then all they will have to do is submit artifacts demonstrating those students' ethical reasoning abilities. Identifying information will be removed from the artifacts, and a small team of faculty will assess those items as part of a short-term summer 2019 research project.</p><p>Details regarding how to submit artifacts will be provided at the beginning of the fall semester. For now, feel free to familiarize yourself with the <a href="/facultyIS/assessmentresources/Documents/Ethical%20Reasoning%20Rubric.pdf">Ethical Reasoning rubric</a>.</p></div>

<div><b>Article Content:</b> <p>I want to bring everyone up to speed on&#160;projects that happening on the Riverfront Campus this summer, and their impact on the college.<br></p><p>Thank you for your patience and cooperation while we complete these projects to improve the physical environment of our campus.<br></p><p><strong>Replacing boiling and water cooling</strong><br></p><p>The college is taking a&#160;phased approach to replace the antiquated steam boiler heating plant and the chilled water cooling systems on Riverfront Campus.&#160;We will be changing over from steam boilers to high efficient hot water boilers and the chillers will be replaced with new high efficient chillers and cooling towers. The first phase, which has started, will&#160;remove&#160;one of the three main steam boilers, heat exchangers, and all associated piping.&#160;We will then&#160;install&#160;the first two of four hot water boilers along with new distribution piping.&#160;The work during the first phase will be in the boiler room, mechanical room in front of the main reception desk, north side and south corridor of the Health Careers Center for Excellence&#160;Building, Prairie Building, and the Technology&#160;Building. This is a large project encompassing multiple student and faculty areas.&#160;We are working with the contractors to work around the college’s academic schedule in a way that will limit disruptions.&#160;The biggest impact of the project--affecting&#160;the entire Riverfront Campus--will be the lack of heat.&#160; Beginning May 14, we will shut&#160;down the boiler plant to begin the demo phase of the project.&#160; This could become an issue because we currently use heat to temper the air during the cooling season.&#160;Without heat, we cannot&#160;control the temperature of air &#160;supplied to each area.&#160;</p><p>The good news&#58; Physical Plant Department has a control strategy in place to help mitigate any excessive cooling.&#160;If&#160;temperatures get&#160;too chilly, please call to PPD at ext.&#160;8170 or ext. 8174 to share the cold&#160;area and we will make further adjustments to the system that will allow the space to warm back up.&#160;The bulk of the work begins May 14 and will be complete&#160;before the start of&#160;fall semester.</p><p><strong>Remodel bathroom</strong></p><p>Beginning May 14, we will begin to&#160;remodel the third floor women’s east restroom near Adult Education offices.&#160;The restroom will be closed from May 14 to&#160;mid-July.&#160;Upon completion,&#160;it will look very similar to the women’s restroom near&#160;Financial Aid.<br></p><p><strong>Foundation moving</strong></p><p><strong></strong>Beginning May 14, we will be converting Room&#160;D211 into the new Foundation offices.&#160;This work will be completed by June 30.<br></p></div>

<div><b>Article Content:</b> <p>National Medical Laboratory Professionals Week will be April 22-28, 2018.&#160;<br></p><p>This week recognizes the contributions of professionals whose work in the medical/clinical laboratory helps give our nation the best possible health care. These medical laboratory personnel play an increasingly vital role in the diagnosis and prevention of disease; and often their dedicated efforts are unseen as they work behind the scenes.</p><p>Every day, nurses, physicians, and other healthcare workers depend on laboratory professionals to perform tests on blood and other body fluids, interpret the results, and help provide a complete picture of a patient’s health. Using modern biomedical equipment and complicated analysis, laboratorians can detect the presence of cancer, identify infectious viruses and bacteria, and measure glucose, cholesterol, or drug levels in blood. Without this precise and valuable information, medicine would simply become guesswork.</p><p>From April 22- 28, 2018, please join these dedicated professionals in celebrating Medical Laboratory Professionals Week and their vital role in protecting and promoting your health.</p><p>First year KCC Medical Laboratory Technology (MLT) students will be in attendance for their program course labs (M139) Thursday, April 26 from 8 a.m. - 5&#58;30 p.m. All staff and other students are invited to stop by and “see them in action”&#160; - performing some medical laboratory tests.</p><p>To view a video about KCC's program, go to <a href="https&#58;//youtu.be/8OYl6N7w2ZA">https&#58;//youtu.be/8OYl6N7w2ZA</a>.<br></p></div>

<div><b>Article Content:</b> <p>​After an extended hiatus the MSE Division fired up the taste buds in the sixth quasi-annual MSE Cook-Off.&#160; Competition in this culinary battle was fierce; the prize was the highly coveted flouncy pink apron won and worn most notably in years past by Bob Ling and Kristen Larson.&#160; This year's theme required a dish from the cook's heritage and an epic battle ensued.&#160; The winner of the previous sortie, JP Cohen with his &quot;bowls of steel&quot; chili, reluctantly surrendered the bounty and tied the strings on a new champion – Ruth Fabbro with her jambalaya.<br></p></div>

Ruffalo Noel Levitz is administering the survey and--as a third-party--helps assure that answers will be confidential. Information pertaining to individual identities will not be shared. </p><p>KCC is&#160;encouraging all full-time employees, current adjunct instructors, and part-time employees averaging 16 hours or more of work per week to complete&#160;the employee satisfaction survey. </p><p>This will be the seventh year we have used Noel Levitz to administer the survey. It allows for comparison between years to see how we are doing, as well as a comparison to approximately 30 other community colleges across the nation. We hope to have the survey results compiled and distributed sometime in April.&#160;</p><p>Here are questions and answers related to the survey, which&#160;have been asked before&#58;</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;Q&#58; Can the survey be saved and restarted if I am interrupted? </p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A&#58; Yes, as long as you use the same computer when returning to the survey.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><p>&#160;&#160; &#160;Q&#58; Can we offer some type of incentives to employees for completing the survey in order to increase participation? </p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A&#58; KCC is offering an incentive for the completion of THIS survey only (not to be precedent setting for other surveys).&#160;Upon completion of the survey, you will be given the opportunity to print off a coupon for a medium size coffee or 20 ounce pop (Approx. $2.00 value) redeemable in the Hammes Café.&#160; Additionally, if you put your name on the bottom of the coupon, you will be entered into a second incentive where we will draw four names with each person winning a $25 Wal-Mart gift certificate.&#160;&#160;</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160; As always, thank you in advance for your cooperation and honest/constructive feedback.</p></div>

<div aria-labelledby="ctl00_PlaceHolderMain_ctl02_label" style="display&#58;inline;"><p class="mv-Element-P">​Students, faculty and staff 
are invited to a grand opening celebration for KCC’s food pantry on Wednesday, 
Feb. 14, at 2 p.m. in Room 307 on the Riverfront Campus. Ribbon cutting and 
remarks are scheduled for 2&#58;30 p.m. Refreshments—including Valentine’s 
candy—will be available.</p><p class="mv-Element-P">“It’s tough to concentrate in class when you’re hungry, or 
if you’re worrying how you’ll afford a meal for your family that night,” said 
Francesca Catalano, KCC’s associate dean for math, science and engineering, who 
is coordinating the pantry. “That’s why we’re promoting it as ‘Food for 
Thought,’ as you’ll see from the signage on the door and around campus. We know 
our pantry will help the most vulnerable among us.”</p><p class="mv-Element-P">The pantry is in the Arts and Sciences Building, Room R312 
and it is for KCC students.&#160;Donations are being accepted for non-perishable food 
in the white bins near the First Floor Information Desk. Monetary donations to 
the pantry can be made to the KCC Foundation.</p></div></div>

<div><b>Article Content:</b> <p>In the past, Student Services required all&#160;students to make appointments with an advisor for most of the year.<br></p><p> More than 60 percent of appointments did not show up. There were some times with up to a three-week wait to meet with an advisor.&#160;</p><p>This semester, we have implemented an open advising schedule for continuing students. Continuing students can meet with advisors on a first-come/first-serve basis or request an appointment. This allows students flexibility to meet with their advisor when they want.<br></p><p>New students&#160;are still required to schedule an appointment so important academic information and goals can be reviewed.</p><p>New students&#160;can make their appointments online after completing the application. Applicants are informed of this option in a personalized &quot;welcome and next steps&quot; email.</p><p>We hope these changes&#160;will provide students with the best customer service and flexibility.<br></p><p>For more information, please contact Meredith Purcell at <a href="mailto&#58;mpurcell@kcc.edu">mpurcell@kcc.edu</a>&#160;or ext. 8514.<br></p></div>

<div><b>Article Content:</b> <p>The KCC Foundation offices are on the move! </p><p>The entire operation will be moving to Room D211 following the Spring 2018&#160;semester.</p><p>Reasons for the move include&#58;</p><ul><li><strong>Donor access</strong> – parking and an elevator will be closer.</li><li><strong>Confidentiality</strong> – Meeting Room L253 is adjacent to the current Foundation offices. The frequent activity in that room, and people waiting outside the door for their meeting to begin, result in a compromise of confidentiality that Foundation staff can have in donor conversations.</li><li><strong>Increased utilization of meeting rooms</strong> – The Foundation will have easier access to Room&#160;D300 for Foundation Board and committee meetings. </li><li><strong>More L253 for everyone else</strong> - Other groups desiring to use Room L253&#160;will have expanded access to it.</li></ul><p>Patience and adaptability are appreciated by all as the institution makes this forward move to improve Foundation access and interactions with donors.</p></div>

<div><b>Article Image:</b> <img alt="" src="/PublishingImages/Update/foundation150x150.jpg" style="BORDER: 0px solid; "></div>
<div><b>Article Content:</b> <p>With the beginning of the semester I wanted to share good news. We have met and exceeded our goal of $21,460 for the KCC Employee Giving Campaign. Your gifts will assist students in need through Compassion Fund, will help remove barriers to completion with your investment in Women’s Giving Circle, will provide funding for scholarships, will enable the Foundation to fund equipment needed for instruction and assist students who lack funding for books and supplies.&#160;</p><p>Thank you for your generosity!&#160;</p><p>As a reminder, those of you who have recurring gifts to the Employee Giving Fund, your recurring gift began with the Jan. 5, 2018 payroll. Recurring gifts are the gifts that keep on giving (if you indicate recurring on the Employee Giving Form your gift will continue--as is--year after year).&#160;</p><p>If you have not given yet, there is still time. The campaign goes until the end of the fiscal year. Each dollar assists students in their success. You can give <a href="https&#58;//51743.thankyou4caring.org/pages/employee-online-giving">online</a> or you can fill out the <a href="http&#58;//www.kcc.edu/Foundation/giving/eg/Documents/Foundation-Giving-Form-1-5-18.pdf">PDF&#160;form</a> and return it&#160;to the Foundation Office.</p><p>Thank you for your caring support.<br></p></div>

      <description><![CDATA[<div><b>Article Description:</b> KCC was reapproved for ATEC funds.</div>
<div><b>Article Category:</b> Update (Faculty and Staff Newsletter)</div>
<div><b>Article Content:</b> <div>Greetings everyone -</div><div><br></div><div>We learned yesterday that Kankakee Community College was re-approved by the Governor’s office and the Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity to move forward with the Advanced Technology Education Center (ATEC).&#160;Rep. Lindsay Parkhurst delivered the news and plans a press release to announce the project moving forward.&#160;</div><div><br></div><div>It is still unclear as to when the funds will be released, however, this is a great sign.&#160;It’s also exciting that this project will continue and ultimately offer programs that lead to good paying jobs.</div><div><br></div><div>As many of you know, ATEC construction began in 2015 on the Riverfront Campus. But, funds were halted at the state level and the project has been stagnant for the past 2+ years.&#160;&#160;</div><div><br></div><div>We expect construction to resume as soon as the funds are released, however, we can begin engaging our construction partners for planning.&#160; We will keep the college community informed when we have the timeline to share.&#160;</div><div><br></div><div>ATEC is designed with classrooms, labs, offices, and support spaces. It will be the place for hands-on technical training in wind generation, solar thermal, solar photo-voltaic systems, and electrical (National Electric Code NEC) instruction. It’s been designed to meet or exceed requirements for the US Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environment Design (LEED) Gold certification.&#160;<br></div></div>

A barrel to place your donated food items in will be available at the front desk.&#160; This will be on the honor system and if you forget to bring in a food item to donate, you can always make a cash donation to benefit KCC's Food Pantry.&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><p>Other festivities will occur Dec 18-20 and will be communicated a bit later after all of the details are finalized.&#160;&#160;</p></div>

This will be the 10th year that areas of the college have competed against each other for the best Halloween costumes and department theme.</p><p>&quot;I can't believe we have been holding this fantastic annual competition on the main campus for 10 years now,&quot; said Sheila Pfaff, one of the competition organizers. &quot;I hope those brain juices have been flowing over the past year and people aren't stuck in the Beetlejuice waiting room! I can't wait!&quot;</p><p>Each area's theme must be kept under wraps to keep the competition from borrowing ideas. As an incentive, the winning department will keep the &quot;Fabulous&quot; Traveling Tacky Trophy and will be able to show it off until the 2018 competition.</p><p>There also will be a Traveling Tacky Trophy for best costume. The winner of the best costume does not have to be part of one of the office/area themes.</p><p>If your department or staff in your area would like to get into the spirit of the day, please contact Sheila Pfaff, <a href="mailto&#58;spfaff@kcc.edu"><span style="text-decoration&#58;underline;">spfaff@kcc.edu</span></a> or <span class="baec5a81-e4d6-4674-97f3-e9220f0136c1" style="white-space&#58;nowrap;">815-802-8700<a title="Call&#58; 815-802-8700" href="#" style="margin&#58;0px;border&#58;currentcolor;left&#58;0px;top&#58;0px;width&#58;16px;height&#58;16px;right&#58;0px;bottom&#58;0px;overflow&#58;hidden;vertical-align&#58;middle;float&#58;none;display&#58;inline;white-space&#58;nowrap;position&#58;static !important;"><img title="Call&#58; 815-802-8700" alt="" style="margin&#58;0px;border&#58;currentcolor;left&#58;0px;top&#58;0px;width&#58;16px;height&#58;16px;right&#58;0px;bottom&#58;0px;overflow&#58;hidden;vertical-align&#58;middle;float&#58;none;display&#58;inline;white-space&#58;nowrap;position&#58;static !important;" /></a></span> by Friday, Oct. 20.</p></div>

      <title>Cavalier Cap Challenge is underway! </title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div><b>Article Description:</b> A new Cavalier Cap Challenge recycling competition is under way.</div>
<div><b>Article Category:</b> Update (Faculty and Staff Newsletter)</div>
<div><b>Article Content:</b> 

<div aria-labelledby="ctl00_PlaceHolderMain_ctl02_label" style="display&#58;inline;"><p><img class="ms-rtePosition-1" src="/PublishingImages/Cap-challenge.jpg" alt="" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;144px;" />A new&#160;Cavalier Cap Challenge recycling 
competition is&#160;under way.</p><p>It’s time to form teams – from student clubs/organizations, departments, 
sports teams, or any other group. Teams can register&#160;with the Office of Student 
Life until Friday, Sept. 29. Registrations are in person (Room L116, next to the 
auditorium) or by&#160;email to&#160;<a href="mailto&#58;ltwilliams@kcc.edu"><span style="text-decoration&#58;underline;"><font color="#0066cc">ltwilliams@kcc.edu</font></span></a>.</p><p>The Office of Student Life will have a progress chart located near the Student 
Activities bulletin board. The competition goes through early March 2018. The 
team which collects the most caps will win a pizza party! </p><p>Teams should collect plastic bottle caps and save them in plastic bags. 
Clearly label the bags with the team name before putting it in a Cavalier Cap 
Challenge recycle bin (locations listed below). To participate individually, 
collect bottle caps and place them in any of the seven designated bins!</p><p>It takes 400 pounds of caps --&#160;enough to fill approximately 10 55-gallon yard 
waste/trash bags --&#160;to make a bench. It takes 500 pounds of caps to make a trash 
receptacle, and 1,000 pounds of caps to make a picnic table.&#160; </p><p>The new benches, picnic tables and/or waste receptacles will be placed 
outside of the Riverfront Campus to offer a place to sit and enjoy the campus. 
</p><p>“We would like to continue what Abby Fisher, 2016-17 student trustee, 
started,&quot;&#160;said Linh Williams, coordinator of student life. &quot;The college has a 
beautiful setting and we would like to see more students and community members 
enjoying our outdoor space.&quot;</p><p>Part of the Challenge this year will be to raise funds to help pay for the 
benches, trash receptacles and picnic tables.&#160;The cost of a bench is half price 
if we bring in the required weight in caps.&#160;Many&#160;student clubs have agreed to 
join the effort of raising funds and helping to sort the caps before they are 
taken to be recycled.&#160;If any team or individual would like to sponsor a bench, 
please talk to <a href="mailto&#58;ltwilliams@kcc.edu"><span style="text-decoration&#58;underline;"><font color="#0066cc">Linh Williams</font></span></a> or <a href="mailto&#58;anakaerts@kcc.edu"><span style="text-decoration&#58;underline;"><font color="#0066cc">Alison Nakaerts</font></span></a>. If a bench or other 
cap-creation is sponsored, the group/individual will have a plaque on&#160;it.</p><p>“We hope to bring some fun, friendly competition to campus while also 
encouraging the habit of recycling to our students and staff. Thank you for your 
support and participation!” Williams said.</p><p>Cavalier Cap Challenge bin locations</p><ul><li>First floor- front desk</li><li>College Center</li><li>Workforce Development Center</li><li>Gymnasium</li><li>Second floor- Student Services</li><li>Arts &amp; Sciences Building</li><li>Third floor - near L355</li></ul><p>This <a href="http&#58;//www.kcc.edu/students/studentlife/Documents/Acceptable-Caps-Cap-Challenge.pdf"><span><span style="text-decoration&#58;underline;"><font color="#0066cc">list

and specific action plan, aimed at increasing enrollment.” </p><p>The Strategic Planning Oversight Committee (SPOC) is hosting the forum. 
Afterward, SPOC will use the ideas generated to determine future strategic 
priorities. Action teams will be organized for each of the strategic priorities.

      <description><![CDATA[<div><b>Article Description:</b> Learn about the marketing initiatives we&#39;ve been working on to drive fall enrollment.</div>
<div><b>Article Category:</b> Update (Faculty and Staff Newsletter)</div>
<div><b>Article Content:</b> <p>It is hard to believe the fall semester starts in three short weeks. I wanted to share some of the marketing initiatives we’ve been working throughout the summer to drive additional students for fall. Nancy Schunke has coordinated similar efforts for the South Extension Center market. The entire campaign promotes register.kcc.edu, and we can see clicks and increased traffic to the page when ads run. </p> <h2>Newspaper</h2><p>Running a series of ads in the Daily Journal, Herald and local community newspapers.<br>Press release sent out to encourage fall enrollment and promote the special Saturday registration date.</p><h2>Radio</h2><p>KCC ads are running on area stations, coupled with on-air interviews promoting registration.</p><h2>Outdoor</h2><p>Billboards featuring KCC are in five community locations.</p><h2>Direct Mail</h2><p>A postcard encouraging registration went to most homes in our district area.</p><p>High school juniors and seniors received customized communications throughout the year.</p><h2>Text messages</h2><p>Current students received messages encouraging them to register.</p><h2>Email</h2><p>Current students received email messages promoting registration. </p><h2>Geofencing</h2><p>Technology targeting specific audiences was used to send ads to their cell phones. Engagement was high with these segments. The most recent results reported that 607 people who received the ads visited campus after seeing them. </p><h2>Facebook</h2><p>We have been running Facebook ads on KCC’s page, and we can count the number of people who click on our ads. If any of you have a personal Facebook page we encourage you to follow the KCC pages and share the information on your personal page. Sharing maximizes our exposure for no additional cost. Social media is a great tool to get our messages out with little virtually no cost to the college. https&#58;//www.facebook.com/KankakeeCommunityCollege/ </p><h2>Branding</h2><p>In addition to driving registration, we coordinate ways to tell our story. Check our college’s social media pages on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. We also highlight alumni and student success stories with our ad campaigns, Fabulous Fifty Alumni awards, and stories on our News and Events web page.</p> <p>Today, our enrollment is tracking 10.27% down in credit hours from this time last year.

<div><b>Article Content:</b> <p>​​Because it is a Friday when classes are not being held, on July 7, employees will have the option to following the casual day guidelines&#58; <br>-- Participation is optional.<br>-- Jeans may be worn if accompanied by a collared shirt with &quot;Kankakee Community College&quot; on it or if accompanied by a business casual shirt and a KCC name badge or staff ID. KCC shirts are sold at the Hammes Bookstore and a limited selection is available in marketing and public relations. Prices vary at both locations. Visit the bookstore or Linda Chouinard for more information. <br>-- Staff are asked to use their good judgment in choosing appropriate jeans. Inappropriate jeans include those with patches, fraying, excessive length, low-rise cut and/or very faded. <br>-- Those who choose not to wear jeans should wear their normal work attire; or they can choose to wear a KCC collared shirt along with their normal attire. <br>-- All employee groups can participate. <br>-- Please use good judgment in choosing whether to wear jeans. Depending on what is scheduled for a particular day, jeans may or may not be appropriate. Professional appearance is important, and all employees share the responsibility of representing the college. <br>&#160;<br>Questions regarding casual days should be directed to David Cagle, director of human resources.</p></div>
